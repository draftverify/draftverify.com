      <h1>NA Draft Service Operations Standard</h1>
      <p>
        The operational standard for safely connecting, identifying, verifying, and serving 
        non-alcoholic beverages on draft — including mandatory NFC-enabled Coupler Tags and the 
        DraftVerify Identification Pathway as defined in the DraftVerify Standard v1.0.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section class="section center">

    <h2 class="h2">Why NA Draft Requires a Modern, Verified Service Standard</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      NA draft lives in a unique space: it shares the same storage rooms, towers, and service
      environments as alcoholic beer, but its audience expects absolute certainty. A single
      misconnection at the coupler or an unseen routing mistake inside a walk-in cooler can result
      in a guest being served alcohol when they explicitly chose not to consume it.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      Traditional labels and handwritten markers were never designed to solve that problem.
      Modern NA service needs a system that removes assumption, creates instant clarity, and gives
      staff a way to **confirm** what they’re about to connect. That foundation is the heart of this
      standard — and the reason the DraftVerify Identification Pathway became necessary.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">1. Connecting NA Draft to Today’s Reality</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Where Mistakes Actually Happen</h2>

    <p>
      The industry has always known the weak spots: kegs stored together in shared coolers, lines
      being repurposed between alcoholic and non-alcoholic products, or staff making a quick
      connection during a busy service rush. None of these situations are the fault of the operator —
      they’re a result of draft systems being built decades before NA became a daily expectation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The risk has never been the keg itself. It’s the connection point. The coupler is where 
      identity can be lost, where a mix-up is most likely, and where verification matters most.
      That’s why this standard places the greatest emphasis on Coupler Tag control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every compliant NA draft system begins at the connection point — and every safe connection 
      begins with the Coupler Tag.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="section" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">2. The Role of the Coupler Tag</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Why Verification Must Start at the Keg</h2>

    <p>
      The Coupler Tag is the anchor of the entire DraftVerify system. It is an NFC-enabled,
      cryptographically unique identifier assigned to each NA keg before it enters distribution.
      When staff scan the tag, they are not relying on guesswork — they are confirming the exact keg,
      the exact style, and the exact product identity intended for that line.
    </p>

    <p>
      And because the Coupler Tag cannot be duplicated or reassigned without detection, it creates 
      the kind of certainty the industry has never had before. Every decision downstream — line
      routing, faucet identity, daily checks — is built on that single moment of confirmation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without Coupler Tag verification, the rest of the system cannot function. This is why the use
      of NFC-enabled DraftVerify Coupler Tags is considered mandatory under this standard.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">3. A Unified Identification Pathway</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Creating One Language from Keg to Faucet</h2>

    <p>
      The moment a keg is verified at connection, that identity must follow the beer all the way to
      the glass. Historically, draft systems relied on a patchwork of stickers, tape, and memory. 
      NA draft cannot rely on any of those.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DraftVerify Identification Pathway solves that by creating a single visual and digital
      language across:
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-4" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Keg Tag</h3>
        <p>The keg-level identity that confirms the product is truly NA.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Coupler Tag (NFC)</h3>
        <p>The digital anchor and mandatory point of verification.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Line Marker</h3>
        <p>A clear, durable identity applied along the chosen route.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Faucet Sticker</h3>
        <p>Point-of-pour confirmation for staff and guests alike.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">
      This pathway turns a complicated system into a readable one. Every piece says the same thing,
      and every message is anchored back to the verified keg.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="section" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">4. Verification That Fits Real Service</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Quick, Confident Checks — Even on the Busiest Nights</h2>

    <p>
      Verification isn’t meant to slow staff down. It’s meant to give them confidence. In practice,
      the NFC scan takes less than a second — and it removes every assumption that used to surround
      NA connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most operators follow a simple rhythm:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Scan the Coupler Tag before attaching the coupler.</li>
      <li>Trace the Line Marker to the tower.</li>
      <li>Confirm the Faucet Sticker identity.</li>
      <li>Perform a quick test pour if appropriate.</li>
      <li>Start service knowing the tap is verified.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The process is fast, consistent, and repeatable across shifts — exactly what NA draft has
      always needed.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">5. When Something Doesn’t Look Right</div>
    <h2 class="h2">A Clear Response for Unclear Situations</h2>

    <p>
      Even with a strong system, operators occasionally encounter uncertainty — a mislabeled keg,
      a missing line marker, or a question from staff about whether a tap is truly NA.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under this standard, the rule is straightforward:
      <strong>If you are not certain, treat the tap as alcoholic until verified.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      A quick NFC scan brings clarity instantly. If something doesn’t match the Registry, service
      pauses until the issue is corrected. The goal is simple: zero doubt, zero risk.

    <div class="kicker">6. Conformance</div>
    <h2 class="h2">What It Means to Meet This Standard</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      This operational standard is built around the tools required to make NA draft safe,
      verifiable, and consistent. At the time of publication, the only system capable of
      delivering that complete pathway — from Coupler Tag to Faucet Sticker — is 
      <strong>DraftVerify</strong>.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:10px auto 0;">
      As the category grows and more venues adopt NA draft, this verification-first approach
      provides the reliability and clarity needed to meet guest expectations everywhere NA
      beverages are served.
