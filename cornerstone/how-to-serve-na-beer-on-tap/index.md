# How to Safely Serve Non-Alcoholic Beer on Tap

A step-by-step guide for breweries and venues that want to introduce non-alcoholic (NA) beer on draft without creating confusion, cross-contact, or liability.

Non-alcoholic draft is growing fast — but it isn’t just “another tap.”  
It introduces unique risks:

- Guests choosing NA for health, recovery, religious, or personal reasons  
- Mixed systems where alcoholic and NA lines share towers or coolers  
- Staff working at speed during busy service  

This guide walks through how to design and run NA draft so that every pour is safe, correct, and verifiable.

## 1. Start With the Question: “What Could Go Wrong?”

Before installing the first NA keg, operators should answer:

- How will staff **know** which keg is NA?  
- How will they **trace** the line from keg → tower → faucet?  
- What prevents an alcoholic keg from being connected to an NA faucet?  
- How will incidents be handled if something goes wrong?

If those answers aren’t clear, the system is not ready for NA draft.

For a full framework, see the **NA Draft Safety Standard** and **NA Draft Contamination Prevention** guides.

## 2. Design the Physical Setup

### 2.1 Choose the Right Line

Wherever possible:

- Dedicate **one or more lines exclusively to NA products**  
- Avoid reusing lines that previously carried alcoholic beer unless they are fully cleaned, documented, and re-verified  
- Keep NA kegs in an area of the cooler that is easy to see and organize

### 2.2 Separate Hardware Where You Can

Good practices include:

- A clearly designated NA coupler position or NA-only couplers  
- Simple diagrams in the cooler that show which taps are NA  
- Gas configurations that prevent backflow or line migration into NA pathways

## 3. Label and Identify Everything

Non-alcoholic draft safety lives or dies on **identification**.

At minimum, operators should:

- Use a **keg collar** or tag that clearly states **NON-ALCOHOLIC** and the product name  
- Mark the **beer line** so staff can follow it from keg to tower  
- Mark the **faucet** so guests and staff see that the tap is NA

The DraftVerify identification pathway formalizes this as:

**Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker**

Each of those points should agree on:

- Product name  
- NA status  
- Unique tag or line ID (where used)

---

## 4. Build a Simple NA Draft Checklist

Before service, staff should be able to confirm NA draft integrity in under 60 seconds.

Example daily checklist:

1. **Keg:** The keg tag or collar matches the intended NA product.  
2. **Line:** Line markers match the keg ID and route to the correct tower.  
3. **Faucet:** The faucet sticker/marker matches the same ID.  
4. **Menu:** The printed or digital menu clearly indicates that the tap is non-alcoholic.  
5. **Log:** A quick verification entry is recorded (in a logbook or digital system).

If any step fails, the tap is treated as “not verified” until corrected.

## 5. Train Staff on “What to Do If You’re Unsure”

Mistakes happen when staff feel pressure to guess.

Training should emphasize:

- It is always acceptable to **pause service** from an NA tap until it’s confirmed  
- Staff should **never reconnect** lines or kegs without following the identification pathway  
- Any suspected mix-up should be reported and treated as a formal incident, not a minor issue

In high-volume venues, add a simple rule:

> “If you’re not 100% sure this tap is NA, treat it as alcoholic and stop service until it’s verified.”

---

## 6. Use Verification, Not Just Labels

Labels are the visual layer. Verification is the **process** layer.

A basic NA draft verification routine includes:

- **Initial verification** when the NA line is first installed or converted  
- **Shift checks** confirming the DraftVerify pathway (keg → line → faucet) is intact  
- **Incident documentation** if something goes wrong  
- **Annual review** of the system layout, identification, and cleaning practices

DraftVerify provides a standardized way to combine physical identification with digital records, so operators can show that NA draft is handled with intention — not guesswork.

---

## 7. When Breweries Should Introduce NA Draft

Breweries are good candidates for NA draft when they:

- Already have a consistent NA product in package  
- Work with venues that ask for an NA option on tap  
- Operate taprooms with strong process discipline  
- Are willing to adopt a verification standard rather than ad-hoc practices

Launching NA draft is not just a sales decision — it is a **responsibility** decision.  
A clear framework makes it safe to move ahead.

## 8. Next Steps

If you are considering putting your NA beer on tap:

- Review the **NA Draft Safety Standard** for baseline requirements.  
- Map your draft system and identify which line(s) could be dedicated to NA service.  
- Decide how you will identify and verify keg → line → faucet connections.  
- Consider adopting the **DraftVerify identification and verification framework** so your team, venues, and guests can trust every pour.
