      <h1>NA Draft Identification Guide</h1>
      <p>
        A complete, practical guide to the DraftVerify identification pathway — 
        <strong>Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker</strong> — that makes NA draft 
        traceable and easy to follow in any venue.

    <h2 class="h2">The Visual Language Behind DraftVerify</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Identification is the frontline defense against mispours and misconnection. This guide 
      explains how the DraftVerify system creates a clear, universal visual language that 
      lets staff trace any NA line from the cooler to the faucet in seconds.

<!-- PATHWAY -->
<section class="section" id="pathway">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">1. The Identification Pathway</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker</h2>
    <p>
      The DraftVerify pathway connects three physical points in the system:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Keg Tag</strong> at the coupler or keg connection.</li>
      <li><strong>Line Marker</strong> along the beer line routing to the tower.</li>
      <li><strong>Faucet Sticker</strong> at the point of pour.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      When these three elements are aligned and serialized, staff can visually confirm the 
      correct line during installs, changeovers, and busy service.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- KEG TAG -->
<section class="section" id="keg-tag" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">2. Keg Identification</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Keg Tags: The First Point of Truth</h2>
    <p>
      The keg tag anchors the DraftVerify system. It is the first and most important identifier 
      for an NA product on draft.
    </p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Serialized ID (e.g., DV-SITE-YYYY-#####)</li>
      <li>Durable, legible, and resistant to cooler conditions</li>
      <li>Affixed at the coupler or primary connection point</li>
      <li>Registered in the DraftVerify Registry with product and venue details</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Place tags where they are visible even when kegs are rotated or moved.</li>
      <li>Scan or record the tag whenever a keg is tapped or changed.</li>
      <li>Retire or replace damaged or unreadable tags immediately.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- LINE MARKER -->
<section class="section" id="line-marker">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">3. Line Identification</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Line Markers: Following the Route to the Tower</h2>
    <p>
      Line markers allow staff to confirm exactly which route an NA product takes from the 
      cooler to the tower — critical in venues with multiple lines, manifolds, or shared towers.
    </p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Placed along the line at regular intervals</li>
      <li>Aligned with the keg tag ID and faucet marker</li>
      <li>Durable enough to withstand normal movement and cleaning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply markers near junctions, manifolds, and tower entry points.</li>
      <li>Ensure markers face outward and are readable without moving lines.</li>
      <li>Replace missing or damaged markers during routine checks.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- FAUCET STICKER -->
<section class="section" id="faucet" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">4. Faucet Confirmation</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Faucet Stickers: The Final Signal at the Tap</h2>
    <p>
      At the faucet, the DraftVerify mark provides a clear, visible assurance that the tap is 
      dedicated to NA service — for both staff and guests.
    </p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Holographic or otherwise distinct NA identifier</li>
      <li>Placement at or immediately adjacent to the faucet</li>
      <li>Aligned with the corresponding keg tag and line markers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install on clean, dry surfaces to maximize adhesion and visibility.</li>
      <li>Position where guests can easily see the NA mark at ordering distance.</li>
      <li>Replace if faded, peeling, or visually compromised.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- SCENARIOS -->
<section class="section" id="scenarios">

    <div class="kicker">5. Common Layout Scenarios</div>
    <h2 class="h2">How Identification Works in Real Venues</h2>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Mixed Towers</h3>
        <p>
          NA and alcoholic lines share a tower body. DraftVerify ensures the NA tap has its own 
          complete pathway, making it easy to confirm during service.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Multi-Line Draft Walls</h3>
        <p>
          High line counts make visual tracing difficult. Line markers and serialized tags keep 
          each NA route clearly defined.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Mobile / Event Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Jockey boxes and mobile rigs see frequent reconfiguration. The DraftVerify pathway 
          prevents guesswork during fast setups.

<!-- DIGITAL LAYER -->
<section class="section" id="digital" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">6. Digital Traceability</div>
    <h2 class="h2">The Software Behind Physical Identification</h2>
    <p>
      Physical identification is only part of the picture. The DraftVerify platform connects 
      every tag, line, and faucet to a digital record.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tag registry:</strong> which product is on which NA line, at which venue.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification logs:</strong> confirmation that the pathway has been checked.</li>
      <li><strong>Change history:</strong> when a keg was swapped or a line rerouted.</li>
      <li><strong>Training completion:</strong> which staff are cleared to work with NA lines.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This combination of physical clarity and digital traceability is what turns DraftVerify 
      from “just tags” into a full NA draft identification standard.

    <h2 class="h2">Who Maintains the Identification System?</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Day-to-day, identification is managed by the venue — but it is supported and reinforced 
      by breweries, distributors, and group operators who require consistent handling of their 
      NA products.
