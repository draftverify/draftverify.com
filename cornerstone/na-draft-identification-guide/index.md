# NA Draft Identification Guide
A complete guide to identifying every non-alcoholic draft system using the DraftVerify pathway:  
**Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker**

This universal visual system enables staff to trace the NA route in seconds — even during peak service.

---

## 1. Why Identification Matters
Non-alcoholic draft products are the **only** beverages that can be misidentified during service.  
Shared towers, equipment swaps, and changeovers create genuine risks.

Proper identification ensures:
- Guests get exactly what they expect  
- Staff never pull the wrong line  
- Breweries protect brand integrity  
- Venues reduce operational mistakes  

---

## 2. The DraftVerify Identification Pathway

### **1. Keg Tag**
A serialized ID tag placed at the coupler connection point.

**Purpose:**  
- Marks the beverage as NA  
- Links to the digital registry  
- Identifies the product currently on tap  

**Best Practices:**  
- Place tag at eye level  
- Keep tag visible when keg is rotated  
- Scan during keg changeover  

---

### **2. Beer Line Marker**
A visible marker attached along the beer line's length.

**Purpose:**  
- Allows staff to visually follow the NA line  
- Prevents confusion during tower service or reconnects  
- Maintains compliance when towers are shared  

**Best Practices:**  
- Place markers every 12–18 inches  
- Ensure markers face outward  
- Replace markers after line cleaning if removed  

---

### **3. Faucet Sticker**
A holographic NA identifier at the faucet.

**Purpose:**  
- Final confirmation at the point of pour  
- Ensures guests see that the tap is NA  
- Prevents accidental alcoholic pours  

**Best Practices:**  
- Place above or directly on the tap  
- Use clean, dry surfaces  
- Replace if peeled or worn  

---

## 3. Identification Examples

### **Mixed Tower Setup**
- One alcoholic line  
- One NA line  
- Both routes must remain clearly distinct  

### **Multi-Line Tower**
- Several NA and alcoholic lines  
- Each NA line must carry the full pathway  

### **Mobile Draft / Jockey Box**
- NA hose must be dedicated or re-verified  
- Tags remain visible on external couplers  

---

## 4. Digital Traceability
Identifying the system is only half the process — operators also log:

- Keg tag scans  
- Line verification checks  
- Service events  
- Changeovers  
- Training completion  

This creates a permanent, auditable record.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Identification

### **Tag missing?**
Re-issue immediately. Do not serve NA until resolved.

### **Line marker damaged?**
Replace and verify routing.

### **Faucet sticker missing?**
Stop service until restored.

### **Unsure which keg is NA?**
Stop service → reverify → scan tag.

## 6. Responsibilities
- **Operators:** Maintain visible identification  
- **Staff:** Verify before serving  
- **Breweries:** Provide product-level clarity  
- **Groups:** Standardize across locations
