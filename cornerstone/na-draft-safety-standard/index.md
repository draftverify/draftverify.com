      <p>
        A complete guide to the safety, identification, and verification requirements that ensure 
        non-alcoholic draft products are dispensed without contamination or misidentification — 
        supported by the DraftVerify traceability platform.

    <h2 class="h2">Why Non-Alcoholic Draft Requires Its Own Safety Protocol</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic (NA) draft service introduces risks that alcoholic draft systems do not. 
      NA products can be misidentified, misconnected, or contaminated by alcohol-bearing lines, 
      cleaning fluids, or equipment residue. This guide outlines the safety standards every venue, brewery, 
      and distributor must follow to protect guests, maintain product integrity, and ensure accurate service.

    <h2 class="h2">The Four Safety Pillars of NA Draft</h2>

1. **Separation** — NA lines, couplers, and gas pathways must remain physically isolated  
2. **Identification** — The system must visually signal NA status from keg → line → faucet  
3. **Verification** — Line alignment must be confirmed before every service cycle  
4. **Traceability** — All data must be logged for operational integrity and auditability

    <h2 class="h2">Non-Alcoholic Lines Must Never Share Infrastructure</h2>

### Required Safety Practices
- NA lines must not be reused for alcoholic beverages unless reverified  
- Gas systems must include backflow protection  
- Shared towers must document separation protocols  
- Cleaning schedules must prevent cross-fluid transfer

    <h2 class="h2">The Visual System That Prevents Misconnections</h2>
    <p>
      DraftVerify's identification system establishes a unified visual language that clearly marks 
      NA components end-to-end. This removes guesswork during busy service and prevents staff from 
      connecting or pouring the wrong line.
    </p>

### Identification Components
- **Keg Tag** — serialized and registered  
- **Line Marker** — applied along the beer line  
- **Faucet Sticker** — final point-of-pour confirmation

    <h2 class="h2">Ensuring the Right Line Is Connected Every Time</h2>

### Verification Requirements
- Confirm the tagged keg connects to the tagged line  
- Confirm the line leads to the correct faucet  
- Log verification events digitally  
- Re-verify after equipment changes, cleaning, or staff turnover

    <h2 class="h2">The Digital Backbone Protecting Every Pour</h2>

DraftVerify's digital platform is not optional — it provides:

- **Trackable tag IDs** for each NA connection point  
- **Audit logs** of verification events  
- **Cleaning and maintenance records**  
- **Training certification data**  
- **Multi-venue dashboards** for enterprise operators
