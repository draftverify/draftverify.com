      <h1>NA Draft Safety Standard</h1>
      <p>
        The core operational framework for safely storing, handling, identifying, and serving 
        non-alcoholic beverages on draft — aligned with the DraftVerify Standard v1.0.

    <h2 class="h2">Why NA Draft Needs Its Own Safety Standard</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic (NA) draft service carries unique risks: misidentification, accidental 
      cross-contact, and inconsistent practices across locations. The NA Draft Safety Standard 
      defines the baseline controls needed so that any venue can safely pour NA products with 
      confidence.

<section class="section" id="purpose">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">1. Purpose & Scope</div>
    <h2 class="h2">What This Standard Covers</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To establish the minimum operational requirements that ensure beverages represented as 
      non-alcoholic are dispensed from draft systems free of contamination, cross-contact, or 
      misrepresentation.
    </p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NA beer ≤ 0.5% ABV (or local equivalent)</li>
      <li>NA cocktails and RTDs served on draft</li>
      <li>Kombucha and nitro NA beverages</li>
      <li>Bars, restaurants, breweries, taprooms, distributors, and mobile setups</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Brewing and production processes are outside the scope of this document.

    <h2 class="h2">Five Pillars of NA Draft Safety</h2>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Separation</h3>
        <p>NA pathways must remain isolated from alcoholic pathways at all times.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>Every NA connection point must be clearly and durably identified.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <p>Setups must be confirmed and re-confirmed on a defined schedule.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="grid cols-2" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Traceability</h3>
        <p>Key events, changes, and checks must be logged and auditable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>Staff must understand how NA systems are set up, verified, and maintained.</p>

<!-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section" id="system">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">3. System Requirements</div>
    <h2 class="h2">What a Compliant NA Draft System Includes</h2>

    <h3>Physical Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dedicated NA keg couplers or clearly designated NA positions</li>
      <li>Lines that are identified and not reused for alcoholic products without re-verification</li>
      <li>Marked faucets at the point of pour for all NA taps</li>
      <li>Gas systems configured to prevent backflow or line migration</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DraftVerify Identification Pathway</h3>
    <p>
      Every NA line uses the DraftVerify identification pathway:
      <strong>Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker</strong>.  
      This creates a single visual language staff can follow in seconds.
    </p>

    <h3>Environmental Controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NA kegs stored at ≤4&nbsp;°C where feasible</li>
      <li>Clear rotation and dating practices</li>
      <li>Rinse and cleaning methods free of ethanol residues</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- VERIFICATION -->
<section class="section" id="verification" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">4. Verification</div>
    <h2 class="h2">How and When Systems Are Verified</h2>
    <p>
      Verification is the process of confirming that the tagged keg, the identified line, and 
      the marked faucet all align and comply with the DraftVerify Standard.
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Verification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Performed when a new NA line is installed or converted</li>
      <li>Includes inspection of identification, routing, gas configuration, and cold storage</li>
      <li>Results recorded in the DraftVerify platform</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Routine Verification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommended at least once per service day or per shift</li>
      <li>Quick checks that the identification pathway is intact and routing is correct</li>
      <li>Logged digitally with timestamp and staff identifier</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Annual Renewal</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Full reassessment of identification, separation controls, and documentation</li>
      <li>Tag registry updated if hardware, layout, or product assignments change</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- RECORDKEEPING -->
<section class="section" id="records">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">5. Recordkeeping & Traceability</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital Records That Back the Standard</h2>
    <p>
      The DraftVerify platform acts as the operational ledger for NA draft systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Required Records</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verification logs:</strong> date, time, staff, and line status</li>
      <li><strong>Change logs:</strong> hardware adjustments, new lines, rerouting</li>
      <li><strong>Cleaning logs:</strong> frequency, method, and responsible team members</li>
      <li><strong>Identification plan:</strong> how NA lines are identified on-site</li>
      <li><strong>Training records:</strong> who has completed NA draft training and when</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These records provide traceability in the event of guest questions, audits, or incident 
      reviews.
    </p>

<!-- INCIDENT RESPONSE -->
<section class="section" id="incident">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">6. Incident Handling</div>
    <h2 class="h2">What Happens When Something Goes Wrong</h2>
    <p>
      If contamination or misidentification is suspected, the response must be structured and 
      documented.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Pause service from the affected faucet(s).</li>
      <li>Isolate and label the impacted line and keg.</li>
      <li>Document the incident in the DraftVerify platform.</li>
      <li>Clean, flush, and re-sanitize the line.</li>
      <li>Perform verification and, where used, optional ethanol testing.</li>
      <li>Rebuild the identification pathway and re-verify before returning to service.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      During investigation, use of the “DraftVerify Certified” mark for that line is considered 
      temporarily suspended.
