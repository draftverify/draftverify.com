# NA Draft Safety Standard
The operational foundation for safely storing, handling, identifying, and serving non-alcoholic (NA) beverages on draft.

DraftVerify’s NA Draft Safety Standard is the first industry-developed framework designed to keep NA draft systems free from misidentification, accidental alcohol exposure, and line confusion — especially in mixed alcoholic/NA environments.

This standard applies to breweries, venues, distributors, mobile setups, and draft installers.

---

## 1. Purpose
The NA Draft Safety Standard establishes the minimum safety and operational requirements needed to ensure that beverages represented as non-alcoholic are dispensed from systems free of contamination, cross-contact, or misrepresentation.

The standard protects:
- **Consumers** who rely on accurate alcohol representation  
- **Breweries** who need their NA products handled correctly  
- **Venues** who require consistent, documented operational controls  

---

## 2. Scope & Applicability
This standard applies to:

- NA beer (≤0.5% ABV or local equivalent)  
- Kombucha on draft  
- Ready-to-drink NA cocktails  
- Nitro NA beverages  
- Any venue serving NA products from mixed or dedicated draft lines  

This standard does **not** cover brewing, production, or packaging practices.

---

## 3. Core Principles
### **1. Separation**
NA pathways must remain isolated from alcoholic pathways at all times.

### **2. Identification**
NA components require consistent, durable, and unambiguous identification.

### **3. Verification**
Operators must maintain proof that NA lines are correctly set up and remain compliant.

### **4. Traceability**
Connection points, service events, and changes must be recorded digitally.

### **5. Training**
Staff must receive recurring education on handling, cleaning, and confirming NA systems.

---

## 4. System Requirements

### **A. Physical Components**
- Dedicated keg coupler for NA  
- Clearly identified beer line  
- Marked faucet at the point of pour  
- Backflow-safe gas configuration  
- Written procedures for changeovers  

### **B. DraftVerify Identification Pathway**
Operators must implement the NA identification pathway:

**Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker**

This ensures staff can visually trace the NA route in seconds.

### **C. Environmental Controls**
- Store NA kegs at ≤4°C  
- Use clean, ethanol-free rinsing processes  
- Avoid splash contamination during alcoholic line cleaning  

---

## 5. Verification Requirements
Verification confirms the system is correctly identified, connected, and compliant.

### **Initial Verification**
Performed when an NA line is first set up or reconfigured.

### **Routine Verification**
Minimum **once per shift** during service hours.

### **Annual Renewal**
Full system reassessment + registry update.

Each verification is logged in the digital platform.

---

## 6. Recordkeeping & Documentation
Operators must maintain:

- **Verification logs** (timestamped, digital)  
- **Change logs** for hardware adjustments  
- **Cleaning logs**  
- **Identification plans** clarified in writing  

The DraftVerify platform automates this.

---

## 7. Incident Response
If contamination or misidentification is suspected:

1. **Stop service immediately**  
2. **Isolate the affected line**  
3. **Document the issue**  
4. **Clean and re-verify**  
5. **Update the digital log**  
6. **Re-issue tags if needed**  

Certification remains paused until completion.

---

## 8. Responsibilities
- **Operator:** Implements and maintains the standard  
- **Distributor/Installer:** Ensures compliant setup  
- **Verifier:** Confirms conformance and updates registry  

---

## 9. Misuse of Certification Mark
The “DraftVerify Certified” mark may only be used when:

- All NA pathways meet the standard  
- Verification is current  
- Digital logs are complete  

Misuse may result in revocation.

---

## 10. Revision Policy
This standard is reviewed annually.
