    <h2 class="h2">Protecting Non-Alcoholic Draft from Alcohol Exposure</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic (NA) draft lines are uniquely vulnerable: a single incorrect changeover, 
      shared fitting, or cleaning cycle can introduce ethanol into the system. This guide explains 
      how contamination happens, how to prevent it, and how DraftVerify provides operational 
      safeguards through identification, separation, and digital tracking.

<!-- WHAT IS CROSS-CONTACT -->
<section class="section" id="cross-contact">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">1. Definition</div>
    <h2 class="h2">What Is Cross-Contact?</h2>
    <p>
      Cross-contact occurs when alcoholic liquid or vapor enters an NA draft pathway due to shared 
      equipment, incorrect routing, or poor process control. Even trace ethanol can undermine guest 
      trust and compromise the NA product.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Cross-Contact Pathways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reusing alcoholic lines for NA without full re-verification</li>
      <li>Shared towers where internal routing is not clearly identified</li>
      <li>Cleaning fluid crossover between alcoholic and NA circuits</li>
      <li>Gas system backflow pushing alcoholic liquid into NA lines</li>
      <li>Splash or spill contamination in the cooler or service area</li>
      <li>Service work that disconnects/reconnects lines incorrectly</li>
    </ul>

<!-- HIGH-RISK SCENARIOS -->
<section class="section" id="risk-scenarios" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">2. High-Risk Scenarios</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Where Contamination Is Most Likely to Occur</h2>
    <p>
      Prevention starts with knowing where things go wrong. The following scenarios represent the 
      highest risk for NA contamination.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Shared Towers</h3>
        <p>
          NA and alcoholic faucets share a tower body. Misrouted tubing, incorrect reconnects, or 
          poor labeling can lead to accidental cross-contact.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Line Reuse</h3>
        <p>
          An alcoholic line is repurposed for NA without proper cleaning, re-verification, or 
          documentation. This is not permitted under the DraftVerify Standard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Service & Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          External technicians may temporarily disconnect lines or fittings. Without clear 
          identification and a verification step, NA and alcoholic pathways can be mixed.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Cleaning Cycles</h3>
        <p>
          If cleaning manifolds or jumpers are shared between NA and alcoholic lines, fluids can 
          migrate into NA pathways.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Busy Changeovers</h3>
        <p>
          During peak hours, a rushed keg change can connect the wrong product to an NA-labeled 
          faucet if the system is not clearly identified and verified.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Mobile or Event Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Portable setups (jockey boxes, event rigs) are often reconfigured quickly, increasing 
          the risk of misconnection without proper controls.

<!-- PREVENTION FRAMEWORK -->
<section class="section" id="framework">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">3. Prevention Framework</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Three Layers of Protection</h2>
    <p>
      DraftVerify uses three integrated layers to prevent contamination and keep NA lines clean, 
      correct, and trusted.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <div class="chip">Layer 1</div>
        <h3>Physical Identification</h3>
        <p>
          The DraftVerify pathway <strong>Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker</strong> ensures 
          staff always know which keg feeds which faucet. This is the first line of defense.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <div class="chip">Layer 2</div>
        <h3>Separation Controls</h3>
        <p>
          Dedicated NA lines, NA-only jumpers, backflow-safe gas configurations, and clear tower 
          routing prevent alcoholic pathways from intersecting with NA.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <div class="chip">Layer 3</div>
        <h3>Digital Verification</h3>
        <p>
          The DraftVerify platform logs line connections, cleaning cycles, changeovers, and 
          verification events — providing a permanent, auditable record.
        </p>

<!-- CLEANING & MAINTENANCE -->
<section class="section" id="cleaning" style="background:#f7f9fc">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">4. Cleaning & Maintenance</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Routine Controls That Protect NA Lines</h2>
    <p>
      Cleaning is both a hygiene requirement and a contamination risk if not handled properly. 
      NA lines should follow a documented schedule with clear responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Daily</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the full DraftVerify identification pathway is intact.</li>
      <li>Log a quick NA line verification in the digital system.</li>
      <li>Inspect faucets and tower area for spills or residue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weekly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect line markers for visibility, placement, and wear.</li>
      <li>Review cold storage organization to avoid keg mix-ups.</li>
      <li>Log all keg changeovers with tag IDs and timestamps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monthly (or per local best practice)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform full line cleaning following manufacturer guidance.</li>
      <li>Ensure NA cleaning lines are not shared with alcoholic circuits.</li>
      <li>Update digital cleaning logs and re-verify routing after service.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- DETECTION METHODS -->
<section class="section" id="detection">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">5. Detection Methods</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Checking for Possible Contamination</h2>
    <p>
      While many operators rely on process controls alone, some breweries and groups may choose 
      to periodically test NA lines for added assurance.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rinse-through ethanol screening:</strong> simple checks for alcohol presence in line rinse samples.</li>
      <li><strong>Enzymatic ethanol tests:</strong> detect trace levels of ethanol in NA product samples.</li>
      <li><strong>Spectrometric analysis (advanced):</strong> lab-grade tools used by breweries or large groups.</li>
      <li><strong>ATP surface testing:</strong> confirms sanitary conditions at couplers, towers, and fittings.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- INCIDENT RESPONSE -->
<section class="section" id="incident">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">6. Incident Response</div>
    <h2 class="h2">What to Do If You Suspect Contamination</h2>
    <p>
      If there is any doubt about the integrity of an NA line, service should be halted and the 
      issue treated as a formal incident.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Stop service from the suspected faucet immediately.</li>
      <li>Isolate and disconnect the associated keg.</li>
      <li>Document the incident in the DraftVerify platform.</li>
      <li>Flush, clean, and re-sanitize the line.</li>
      <li>Perform an ethanol screening if available.</li>
      <li>Rebuild the identification pathway (keg, line, faucet).</li>
      <li>Re-verify and log the system before resuming service.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      During this process, “DraftVerify Certified” status for the affected line is considered 
      temporarily suspended until corrective action is complete.

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Cross-contact is not just a technical problem — it is a trust problem. Guests choose 
      non-alcoholic products for a reason. Breweries build NA portfolios to serve those 
      needs. Venues who adopt DraftVerify’s contamination-prevention framework demonstrate 
      that they take that responsibility seriously.

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:18px auto 0">
      DraftVerify gives operators practical controls, clear identification, and a digital 
      audit trail so NA draft can be poured with confidence at any scale.
