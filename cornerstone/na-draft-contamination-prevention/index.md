# NA Draft Contamination Prevention
A comprehensive guide to preventing alcoholic cross-contact in non-alcoholic (NA) draft systems.

This guide outlines how contamination happens, how to prevent it, and how DraftVerify provides operational safeguards through identification, separation, and digital tracking.

---

## 1. What Is Cross-Contact?
Cross-contact occurs when alcoholic liquid or vapor enters the NA system due to:

- Shared or reused lines  
- Incorrect coupler changes  
- Cleaning fluid crossover  
- Splash contamination  
- Incorrect gas routing  
- Tower misconfiguration  

Even **trace** ethanol can compromise NA product integrity.

---

## 2. High-Risk Scenarios

### **Shared Towers**
When NA and alcoholic faucets share the same tower, misrouting or reconnecting can cause cross-contact.

### **Line Reuse**
Reusing an alcoholic line for NA without re-verification is prohibited.

### **Service Work**
Third-party technicians may disconnect lines incorrectly without clear identification.

### **Changeovers During Busy Shifts**
Staff may accidentally connect the wrong keg.

### **Cleaning Cycles**
Alcoholic lines may drain into NA lines if fittings are shared.

---

## 3. Prevention Framework
DraftVerify provides three layers of protection.

---

### **Layer 1 — Physical Identification**
Clear identification is the first defense:

**Keg Tag → Line Marker → Faucet Sticker**

This pathway makes it impossible to accidentally pull the wrong line when used correctly.

---

### **Layer 2 — Separation Controls**
Operators must implement:

- Dedicated NA hoses  
- Isolation valves where required  
- Gas backflow protection  
- NA-only jumper lines  
- Clean, ethanol-free rinse procedures  

---

### **Layer 3 — Digital Verification**
The DraftVerify platform logs:

- Line connections  
- Service work  
- Changeovers  
- Cleaning cycles  
- Verification events  
- Staff training completion  

This ensures accountability across shifts.

---

## 4. Cleaning & Maintenance Controls

### **A. Daily**
- Confirm identification pathway  
- Log verification  
- Inspect faucet sticker  

### **B. Weekly**
- Inspect line markers  
- Confirm cold storage hygiene  
- Log changeovers  

### **C. Monthly**
- Full line cleaning  
- Confirm no alcoholic fluid crossover  
- Update digital cleaning logs  

---

## 5. Cross-Contact Detection Methods

### **1. Rinse-Through Ethanol Screening**
Quick check for alcohol presence.

### **2. Enzymatic Testing**
Detects trace ethanol contamination.

### **3. Spectrometric Detection (Advanced)**
Used by breweries or large groups.

### **4. ATP Surface Testing**
Confirms sanitation of keg couplers and fittings.

---

## 6. Incident Response

If contamination is suspected:

1. Stop service immediately  
2. Remove tagged keg  
3. Flush and clean line  
4. Perform ethanol screen  
5. Reapply identification pathway  
6. Reverify + log event  
7. Issue updated tag if needed  

Certification remains paused until fully resolved.

---

## 7. Operator Responsibilities
- Maintain clear NA identification  
- Confirm correct routing  
- Train staff regularly  
- Log verifications  
- Document service events  

---

## 8. Why Prevention Matters
Cross-contact compromises:

- Consumer trust  
- Brewery brand integrity  
- Venue liability  
- Product safety  

DraftVerify establishes consistent controls so NA draft can be served with confidence at any scale.
