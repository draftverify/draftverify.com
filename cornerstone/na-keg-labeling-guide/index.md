      <h1>NA Keg Labeling & Identification Guide</h1>
      <p>
        A modern, brewery-friendly guide for giving every non-alcoholic (NA) keg a clear, durable,
        and digitally verifiable identity — tied directly into the DraftVerify system.

    <h2 class="h2">Why NA Kegs Need a New Kind of Labeling</h2>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic beer moves through the same distribution chain as everything else: trucks,
      warehouses, shared coolers, festivals, event venues, and multi-site operators. But unlike
      alcoholic products, NA relies on absolute certainty. Guests aren’t just choosing a beer —
      they’re choosing a category.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      For years, breweries relied on collars, stickers, tape, and handwriting to identify kegs.
      That worked when the only concern was style recognition. But NA introduced higher stakes:
      a single mix-up can break trust instantly.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      This guide introduces a simple, modern system built specifically for NA: an NFC-enabled keg
      collar paired with an NFC coupler tag — both tied to a secure DraftVerify record.

    <div class="kicker">1. The Real-World Problem</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Where Identity Gets Lost</h2>

    <p>
      Anyone who has packaged kegs knows the chaos: full pallets leaving the bright tank,
      handwritten markers on masking tape, collars falling off during transport, and condensation
      soaking labels before they even reach the cooler.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment NA kegs enter the wider distribution chain, identity becomes fragile. Paper becomes
      wet. Ink fades. Stickers peel. And once a keg’s label is gone, so is its identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solution isn’t more stickers — it’s a labeling system that carries both physical clarity
      and a digital fingerprint that can’t be lost.

    <h2 class="h2">Everything an NA Keg Needs — and Nothing It Doesn’t</h2>

    <p>
      DraftVerify simplifies NA keg identity into a clean, two-part system:
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-2" style="margin-top:22px">

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>NFC Keg Collar</h3>
        <p>
          The primary identity point. Always visible, always readable. It displays the key details
          visually — brewery, style, NA classification — and includes an integrated NFC chip that
          links directly to the keg’s DraftVerify record.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>NFC Coupler Tag</h3>
        <p>
          The moment of truth happens at the valve. This tag gives staff a way to confirm the exact
          keg before connecting it, using a cryptographically unique NFC ID tied to the same
          DraftVerify record as the collar.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">
      These two components replace the messy patchwork of stickers and handwriting with a single,
      unified identity system that stays with the keg no matter where it travels.

    <div class="kicker">3. Why the Collar Matters</div>
    <h2 class="h2">The Identity Badge Everyone Sees</h2>

    <p>
      The keg collar has always been the “front-of-house” identity of a keg. It’s what people look
      at in the cooler, on a pallet, or when grabbing the next keg to tap.
    </p>

    <p>
      DraftVerify upgrades the collar into something far more powerful: an NFC-enabled identity
      badge. It communicates NA status visually while also holding a digital link to the keg’s
      product, batch, and traceability data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if every other label disappears, the collar still tells the right story — and the NFC
      chip proves it.

    <div class="kicker">4. Why the Coupler Tag Matters</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Identity Confirmed at the Moment It Counts</h2>

    <p>
      The valve is where mistakes happen — the exact point where a keg becomes a tap. The Coupler
      Tag is designed to protect that moment. Its secure NFC ID ensures the keg being tapped is the
      keg the brewery intended.
    </p>

    <p>
      One quick scan, and staff instantly see:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the product</li>
      <li>the batch</li>
      <li>the NA classification</li>
      <li>the keg’s serialized ID</li>
      <li>and any associated DraftVerify details</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The collar tells you what it is.  
      The coupler tag proves it.

    <div class="kicker">5. Placement That Works in the Real World</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Identity Exactly Where People Expect It</h2>

    <p>
      Everyone who works with kegs already knows where to look for information. DraftVerify builds
      on those instincts and adds digital certainty.
    </p>

    <h3>NFC Keg Collar</h3>
    <p>
      Placed on top — always visible, even in a crowded walk-in cooler. It’s the first thing anyone
      sees during storage, transport, or quick checks.
    </p>

    <h3>NFC Coupler Tag</h3>
    <p>
      Secured near the keg valve, it’s perfectly positioned for a quick scan before connecting.
      That’s where accuracy matters most, and where verification happens naturally as part of the
      tapping process.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">
      With these two placements, identity becomes both immediately visible and instantly verifiable.

    <div class="kicker">6. Resetting Kegs When They Return</div>
    <h2 class="h2">A Quick Refresh Before the Next Fill</h2>

    <p>
      Returned kegs don’t need a complicated process — just a quick identity check. Brewers already
      replace collars on refilled kegs. Now they simply verify that the NFC collar and the NFC
      coupler tag match the correct DraftVerify record.
    </p>

    <p>Most breweries follow a simple flow:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Clean & inspect the keg</li>
      <li>Replace the NFC collar if it’s damaged</li>
      <li>Check the Coupler Tag’s NFC scan</li>
      <li>Update the DraftVerify Registry for the next batch</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The keg leaves with the same unified identity it arrived with — refreshed and ready.

    <div class="kicker">7. Why This Matters</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Clear Identity Builds Trust</h2>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto;">
      NA drinkers expect accuracy. Breweries expect their product to be represented correctly.
      Operators expect clarity during service. A modern identity system makes all three possible.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      With just two components — the NFC collar and the NFC coupler tag — DraftVerify creates a 
      complete identity that can’t be mixed up, peeled off, or misread. It’s simple, durable, and 
      built for how breweries and bars actually work.
