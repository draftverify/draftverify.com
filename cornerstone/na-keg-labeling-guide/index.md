      <h1>NA Keg Labeling & Identification Guide</h1>
      <p>
        A modern, brewery-friendly guide for making sure every non-alcoholic (NA) keg 
        leaves the facility with clear labeling, durable identity, and digital traceability — 
        all tied together through the DraftVerify system.

    <h2 class="h2">Why NA Kegs Need Better Labeling Than Ever Before</h2>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      NA products have exploded in popularity, but the keg world hasn’t changed with them. 
      Breweries are still sending NA kegs into distribution using the same collars, stickers, and 
      handwritten notes they’ve always used — and those tools weren’t built for today’s expectations.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      When someone orders NA, they’re trusting everyone in the chain — the brewery, distributor, 
      venue, bartender — to get it right. Clear labeling helps, but it has limits. Paper gets wet. 
      Ink smears. Kegs rub against each other. Coolers get crowded.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      This guide explains how to give every NA keg a physical and digital identity that stays intact 
      through transport, storage, and service.  
      <strong>Today, the only system capable of delivering that level of clarity is DraftVerify.</strong>

    <h2 class="h2">Where Mistakes Start — and How to Prevent Them</h2>

    <p>
      Anyone who has worked in a brewhouse knows how chaotic a packaging day can be. Kegs are 
      moving through rinse cycles, filling lanes, palette staging, and trucking schedules. NA kegs 
      naturally get mixed in with everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      The easiest time for an NA keg to lose its identity is before it ever leaves your own 
      facility — which is why clear labeling and digital identification start here, not at the 
      venue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of this guide as your brewery’s “identity prep” — the simple steps that make the rest 
      of the system work flawlessly downstream.

    <div class="kicker">2. The Four Things Every NA Keg Should Communicate</div>
    <h2 class="h2">A Simple Framework for Making NA Identity Obvious</h2>

    <p>
      No matter where the keg goes — distributor warehouses, festival tents, shared walk-in 
      coolers, national chain venues — staff should be able to understand four things instantly:
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-4" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal"><h3>1. It’s NA</h3><p>Not “probably NA.” Unmistakably NA.</p></div>
      <div class="card reveal"><h3>2. What’s Inside</h3><p>Brewery, style, and product identity.</p></div>
      <div class="card reveal"><h3>3. Where It Came From</h3><p>Batch, fill date, lot, and freshness data.</p></div>
      <div class="card reveal"><h3>4. That It’s the Right Keg</h3><p>A digital ID that removes all guesswork.</p></div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:18px;">
      When all four pieces line up — visually and digitally — you have a keg that can’t be mixed up 
      or misidentified at any point in the chain.

    <div class="kicker">3. The Identity Package</div>
    <h2 class="h2">The Modern, Brewery-Friendly Way to Label NA Kegs</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of treating labeling as a chore, DraftVerify treats it as part of a connected identity 
      system. A compliant NA keg leaves the brewery with three physical elements and one digital one:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keg Collar:</strong> the top-facing badge that says “NON-ALCOHOLIC” loud and clear</li>
      <li><strong>Sidewall Label:</strong> rugged, cooler-proof information for stacked or racked storage</li>
      <li><strong>Coupler Tag (NFC):</strong> the small digital anchor that confirms identity during connection</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Registry Entry:</strong> the authoritative record that ties everything together</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, these four pieces make it almost impossible for a NA keg to disappear into the chaos 
      of a shared cooler or crowded delivery truck.

    <div class="kicker">4. Why NFC Tags Matter</div>
    <h2 class="h2">The Part That Paper Labels Can’t Do</h2>

    <p>
      Every brewery has dealt with collars falling off or labels peeling in the cold. That’s normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      An NFC tag solves the problem paper can’t: it gives the keg a digital fingerprint that 
      doesn’t wear off, doesn’t smear, and doesn’t get lost if everything else does.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a venue scans the tag, they instantly see:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the product</li>
      <li>the batch</li>
      <li>the NA classification</li>
      <li>the keg’s serialized ID</li>
      <li>its next destination (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is why the NFC Coupler Tag is the heart of the DraftVerify system. It’s the one piece 
      that survives every keg’s entire journey.

    <div class="kicker">5. Placement That Works in the Real World</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Where Everything Goes — Based on Actual Brewery Use</h2>

    <p>
      Brewers, cellar staff, drivers, and venue teams all interact with kegs differently. Over time, 
      operators across the industry unknowingly developed “unofficial standards” for where labeling 
      works best.
    </p>

    <p>DraftVerify formalizes those instincts:</p>

    <h3>Keg Collar</h3>
    <p>Up top where it’s impossible to miss — especially in storage.</p>

    <h3>Sidewall Label</h3>
    <p>Low enough to avoid scraping, high enough to remain visible in racks and stacks.</p>

    <h3>Coupler Tag (NFC)</h3>
    <p>Placed near the valve so staff can scan before connecting — the moment where accuracy matters most.</p>

    <p>
      The result is an identity system that works instinctively for anyone who touches the keg.

    <div class="kicker">6. When the Keg Comes Home</div>
    <h2 class="h2">A Quick Reset Before Its Next Journey</h2>

    <p>
      Most breweries already refresh collars and touch up labels on returned kegs. The only new 
      step is confirming that the NFC tag is still intact and connected to the right record.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resetting the keg becomes simple:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Inspect & clean</li>
      <li>Replace any worn physical labels</li>
      <li>Check or swap the NFC tag if needed</li>
      <li>Update the DraftVerify Registry</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      After that, the keg is ready for another safe NA fill — with its identity restored.

    <div class="kicker">7. Why This Matters</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Clear Identity = Safe Service = Trust in Your Product</h2>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto;">
      Brewing a great non-alcoholic beer is only half the story. Making sure it stays NA from the 
      moment it leaves your brewery to the moment someone orders it is the other half — and that’s 
      what this guide is designed to protect.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:20px auto 0;">
      DraftVerify gives breweries, distributors, and venues a shared language for NA keg identity.  
      And right now, it’s the only system that connects physical labels with a digital record that 
      can’t be mistaken for anything else.
