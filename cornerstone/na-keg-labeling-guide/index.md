# NA Keg Labeling & Identification Guide for Breweries

Non-alcoholic kegs move through shared spaces: coolers, trucks, warehouses, and busy bars.  
Without a clear labeling and identification standard, it’s easy for NA kegs to be:

- Misrouted
- Misconnected to alcoholic taps
- Misrepresented on menus

This guide focuses on the **brewery side** — how to label and identify NA kegs so that every downstream venue has what they need to pour safely.

## 1. Core Principles of NA Keg Labeling

A good NA keg labeling system is:

- **Unambiguous** – Anyone can tell it’s non-alcoholic at a glance.  
- **Durable** – Survives condensation, handling, and cooler conditions.  
- **Traceable** – Every keg can be associated with a batch, product, and destination.  
- **Compatible** – Works alongside existing beer labeling practices.

Think of the NA label as both a **safety signal** and a **routing instruction**.

---

## 2. What Every NA Keg Label Should Include

At a minimum, each NA keg should display:

1. **Clear NA Status**  
   - “NON-ALCOHOLIC” in large, high-contrast text  
   - ABV statement (e.g., “≤ 0.5% ABV” or local equivalent)

2. **Product Identity**  
   - Brewery name  
   - Brand / beer name  
   - Style (e.g., Pale Ale, Lager, IPA)

3. **Batch & Fill Information**  
   - Batch or lot code  
   - Fill date  
   - Best-before or recommended freshness date

4. **Keg / Container ID**  
   - Serialized keg ID (e.g., BRW-NA-2025-00123)  
   - Optional barcode or QR/NFC tag linked to a digital record

---

## 3. Physical Label Placement

### 3.1 Keg Collar or Top Label

- Use a **distinctive NA collar** or top label so that from above, the keg is clearly marked as NA.  
- Avoid labels that look identical to alcoholic SKUs except for a small line of text.

### 3.2 Sidewall Label

- Place a second label on the **sidewall** so that NA status is visible when kegs are stacked or racked.  
- Align this with your existing keg branding but use consistent NA visuals (color, wording, or iconography).

### 3.3 Coupler Area / Keg Tag

If using the DraftVerify system:

- Attach a **keg tag** at or near the coupler connection point.  
- Ensure the tag ID is registered in your internal system (and in the DraftVerify registry where used).  
- Match the tag’s product and NA status to the printed labels.

## 4. Color and Design Conventions

You don’t need to overhaul your brand — you need a **repeatable visual pattern**.

Options include:

- A single **NA color band** used on all NA collars and side labels.  
- A consistent **NA icon** (e.g., crossed martini glass, “0.0” icon) placed near the product name.  
- A dedicated **“NA” strip** on the label edge that’s visible even if other details are obscured.

The goal is that warehouse staff, drivers, and bar teams can pick out NA kegs instantly, even in low light or busy coolers.

## 5. Digital Identification and Registry

For breweries using DraftVerify or similar systems, physical labeling should connect to a **digital record**.

A basic record includes:

- Tag or keg ID  
- Product name and style  
- NA status and ABV  
- Batch / lot  
- Fill date  
- Destination (venue or distributor)  
- Optional: verification status once installed at the venue

When NA kegs arrive at a venue, this record can be:

- Scanned via NFC/QR (where used)  
- Logged into a shared system  
- Referenced during verification checks

---

## 6. Handling Keg Returns and Reuse

When NA kegs return to the brewery:

1. **Inspect labels and tags**  
   - Replace damaged or unreadable labels before the keg is reused.  
   - Retire or reprogram tags that are no longer reliable.

2. **Confirm cleaning status**  
   - Follow your normal keg-cleaning SOP.  
   - Ensure internal records reflect that the keg is ready for reuse.

3. **Reset digital state**  
   - Clear or update assignments in your registry so the keg isn’t still “assigned” to the last venue.

This closes the loop and keeps your NA keg fleet both safe and traceable.

---

## 7. Communicating Expectations to Venues

A good NA keg labeling system only works if venues know how to use it.

Include with each NA keg shipment:

- A **short, one-page explainer** of your NA labeling and identification conventions.  
- A reminder that NA kegs should be connected only to lines that are:
  - Correctly identified as NA  
  - Cleaned and verified according to NA draft best practices

For venues participating in the DraftVerify standard, refer them directly to the **NA Draft Safety Standard**, **Identification Guide**, and **Contamination Prevention** resources.

## 8. Summary

For breweries, NA keg labeling is not just a packaging decision — it is the first control point in a larger NA draft safety system.

Clear, durable, and traceable labeling:

- Reduces the risk of alcohol/NA mix-ups  
- Makes it easier for venues to adopt your NA beer on draft  
- Signals to guests that your NA offering is handled with intention

Combined with the DraftVerify identification and verification framework, it gives everyone in the chain — from cellar to faucet — a shared, reliable language for non-alcoholic draft.
