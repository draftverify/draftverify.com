      <h2>1. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      <p>
        The DraftVerify Standards Initiative owns and controls all intellectual property contained
        within this website and the DraftVerify Standards Library, including, without limitation:
        written standards, training materials, workflow descriptions, diagrams, identity models,
        verification protocols, and all associated documents, imagery, and digital assets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless expressly authorized in writing, no part of any DraftVerify material may be copied,
        reproduced, republished, mirrored, adapted, translated, distributed, or stored in any form
        or by any means — in whole or in part. Unauthorized use may constitute copyright
        infringement, passing off, and/or other violations of applicable law.
      </p>

      <p>The following categories of material are specifically protected (non-exhaustive):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The DraftVerify Standard (all versions and language editions)</li>
        <li>The F-Series DraftVerify Standards Library (F-1 through F-40 and related appendices)</li>
        <li>Identity and system models, including Draft Identity Architecture (DIA)</li>
        <li>Verification, logging, and incident-response protocols and specifications</li>
        <li>Brewery, distributor, and venue SOPs, checklists, and implementation guides</li>
        <li>Compliance, audit, and program materials, including multi-venue program criteria</li>
        <li>All diagrams, workflow maps, identity-chain schematics, and system layouts</li>
        <li>
          Distinctive coined terminology and defined concepts used within the DraftVerify Standard,
          including but not limited to terms such as
          <strong>Draft Identity Architecture</strong>, <strong>Verification Event</strong>,
          <strong>Identity Lockout</strong>, <strong>Coupler Identity Tag</strong>,
          <strong>Verified Pour</strong>, and <strong>NA Draft Integrity Zone</strong>, as set out
          in the standards documents.
        </li>
        <li>The DraftVerify logo, symbols, tags, badges, seals, and visual certification identifiers</li>
        <li>DraftVerify Registry descriptions, data models, and interaction specifications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        While general industry concepts and generic phrases are not claimed as proprietary, the
        specific way DraftVerify expresses, structures, and implements its standards and terminology
        is protected. Any attempt to reproduce, repackage, or substantially imitate DraftVerify
        materials in competing standards, frameworks, or commercial offerings is strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <p>
        This protection applies equally to human-authored, AI-assisted, and AI-generated
        reproductions of DraftVerify content or structure where the underlying source is materially
        derived from DraftVerify materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any attempt to copy, imitate, replicate, reverse-engineer, paraphrase, restate, summarize,
        restructure, reorganize, repackage, rebrand, or create any derivative work based on
        DraftVerify™ materials is strictly prohibited. This includes — but is not limited to — all
        written standards, terminology, naming conventions, workflow structures, identity-layer
        architectures, diagrams, protocols, compliance frameworks, and document organization used
        across the DraftVerify Standards Library.
      </p>

      <p>Prohibited actions expressly include, without limitation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using AI tools to generate rewritten or “inspired” versions of DraftVerify materials</li>
        <li>Producing documents that mirror the structure, sequence, or logic of DraftVerify</li>
        <li>
          Creating a competing “standard,” “program,” or “compliance framework” that is inspired by,
          derived from, or substantially similar to DraftVerify in structure, scope, or terminology
        </li>
        <li>
          Replacing DraftVerify terminology with synonyms in an attempt to circumvent copyright,
          trade dress, or other protections
        </li>
        <li>
          Copying or emulating the DraftVerify concept of identity tagging, verification events,
          coupler labeling, line separation frameworks, or registry interaction models in a way that
          is materially based on DraftVerify documentation
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “Substantial similarity” — including conceptual, structural, organizational, or architectural
        similarity — may constitute infringement even where text has been modified, paraphrased, or
        restyled. Independent creation is not a defense where the resulting materials reasonably
        resemble DraftVerify’s protected works, terminology, or identity architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any party attempting to fork, clone, emulate, or build upon the DraftVerify Standard — in
        full or in part — without written authorization may be subject to immediate enforcement
        action, including cease-and-desist demands, removal notices, DMCA or equivalent filings,
        claims for statutory damages, injunctive relief, and recovery of legal fees where permitted
        by law. DraftVerify™ reserves all rights, including the right to determine what constitutes
        derivative, competitive, or infringing use.

    <div class="legal-section" id="trademarks">
      <h2>2. Claimed Trademarks &amp; Marks</h2>
      <p>
        The following names and marks are used as claimed (unregistered) trademarks of the
        DraftVerify Standards Initiative in Canada and other jurisdictions where such common-law
        rights arise through use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DraftVerify™</strong></li>
        <li><strong>DraftVerify Standard™</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Verified Tap™</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Verification Event™</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Identity Architecture™</strong></li>
        <li><strong>NA Integrity™</strong> (provisional claim)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These marks may not be used, in whole or in part, in a manner that is likely to cause
        confusion, suggest endorsement, or imply affiliation with DraftVerify without prior written
        permission. This includes, without limitation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use in product names, services, software, or hardware offerings</li>
        <li>Use in marketing or promotional materials</li>
        <li>Use in training, consulting, or “certification” programs</li>
        <li>Use in domain names, social media handles, or branding assets</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        DraftVerify reserves the right to expand, register, and enforce these and other marks in
        additional jurisdictions over time.

    <div class="legal-section" id="marks-use">
      <h2>3. Use of DraftVerify Names, Badges &amp; Certification Claims</h2>
      <p>
        At this time, DraftVerify does <strong>not</strong> operate a public certification program
        and does <strong>not</strong> grant any of the following statuses to third parties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“DraftVerify Certified”</li>
        <li>“DraftVerify Approved”</li>
        <li>“Verified Tap–Compliant” or similar</li>
        <li>“Official DraftVerify Partner” or similar</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        No brewery, distributor, technician, installer, venue, or vendor may claim or imply DraftVerify
        certification, approval, assessment, audit, or endorsement without a written agreement
        explicitly granting that status.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use of DraftVerify logos, badges, seals, or other visual identifiers on equipment, marketing
        materials, menus, websites, or training content is prohibited without written authorization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Misrepresentation of DraftVerify affiliation or compliance may be treated as deceptive or
        misleading conduct and may result in enforcement action.
