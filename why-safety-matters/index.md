# Why NA Draft Safety Matters
Non-alcoholic draft looks identical to alcoholic draft — but the risks of getting it wrong are dramatically higher. DraftVerify exists to eliminate three core failure points: mis-pours, mis-connections, and contamination.

---

## 1. Accidental Alcohol Service to NA Guests
A guest ordering NA may be:

- Driving  
- Pregnant  
- On medication  
- Avoiding alcohol for health or recovery reasons  

A mis-pour is not “a small mistake.” It can cause serious harm, legal exposure, and a breach of trust.

**Root cause:** Staff cannot visually differentiate NA from alcoholic lines without a standardized system.

---

## 2. Mis-Connections in the Cooler
Coolers are busy environments. Kegs rotate. Staff change. Couplers get swapped quickly.

Without clear identification:

- NA kegs can be connected to alcoholic lines  
- Alcoholic kegs can be connected to NA lines  
- Faucets can be mislabeled or assumed  

**Result:** The tap may dispense something entirely different from what the patron believes.

DraftVerify removes ambiguity with a complete identification chain.

## 3. Contamination & Hygiene Risks
NA beer has different stability characteristics than alcoholic beer. When NA is run through draft systems with inconsistent identification:

- Cross-contamination risk increases  
- Cleaning schedules become harder to maintain  
- Shelf-life assumptions break  
- Brewers lose visibility into how their NA product is handled  

A standardized tagging and verification process protects product integrity.

---

## 4. Liability, Insurance & Operational Exposure
Accidental alcohol service — or misrepresentation of a product on tap — creates exposure for:

- Venues  
- Staff  
- Ownership  
- Breweries providing the product  

DraftVerify provides a documented, repeatable verification process that reduces uncertainty and demonstrates responsible operation.

---

## 5. Standardization Brings Clarity
Tape, markers, and DIY labels are temporary solutions. They don’t survive busy service, and they don’t create accountability.

DraftVerify establishes:

- A permanent physical ID system  
- A digital registry and verification log  
- Monthly and annual compliance records  
- A chain-of-custody for the NA path  

Operators gain a clear standard they can rely on — and prove.

## The Bottom Line
If an NA tap is sold to a customer, it must always be NA.  
DraftVerify ensures that the physical line, the product, and the guest experience remain accurate, consistent, and safe — every single pour.
