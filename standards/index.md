## <a name="foreword"></a>Foreword: About DraftVerify  
DraftVerify was founded to bring scientific integrity and operational consistency to non-alcoholic draft service. As NA offerings expand, so do the risks of misidentification, cross-contact, and guest confusion.

The DraftVerify Standard establishes the first unified operational benchmark for NA draft system integrity.

---

## <a name="purpose"></a>1. Purpose  
The DraftVerify Standard defines identification, handling, and verification requirements ensuring beverages represented as non-alcoholic are dispensed via systems free of contamination or misrepresentation.

---

## <a name="scope"></a>2. Scope  
- Applies to storage, handling, identification, and dispensing of NA beverages through draft systems.  
- Relevant to venues, distributors, and installers operating mixed or dedicated systems.  
- Excludes brewing or production processes.

---

## <a name="definitions"></a>3. Definitions  
- **Non-Alcoholic (NA):** ≤ 0.5% ABV or local equivalent threshold.  
- **Cross-Contact:** Introduction of ethanol-bearing liquid or vapor into NA pathways.  
- **Verification:** Assessment of conformance.  
- **Serialized Tag:** Unique identifier for traceability (e.g., DV-SITE-YYYY-#####).

---

## <a name="core-principles"></a>4. Core Principles  
1. **Separation** — NA pathways must be isolated from alcoholic pathways.  
2. **Identification** — NA components must be visibly and permanently distinguished.  
3. **Verification** — Conformance must be provable through documented records.  
4. **Education** — Personnel must maintain NA handling integrity.

---

## <a name="system-identification-requirements"></a>5. System Identification Requirements  
- Operators must visibly identify NA components using durable markers.  
- A serialized DraftVerify tag must be affixed at the NA coupler or connection point.  
- Operators maintain written procedures preventing NA/alcohol crossover.

---

## <a name="physical-separation--cross-contact-prevention"></a>6. Physical Separation & Cross-Contact Prevention  
- NA lines must not be reused for alcoholic products without re-verification.  
- Gas supply must prevent backflow or migration.  
- Cleaning must avoid NA/alcohol fluid crossover.  
- Shared towers require documented controls.

---

## <a name="handling--storage-cold-chain"></a>7. Handling & Storage  
- Store NA kegs ≤ 4 °C where feasible.  
- Consume tapped kegs within 1–2 weeks.  
- Prevent ethanol exposure during transport or cleaning.

---

## <a name="verification-protocol"></a>8. Verification Protocol  
**Three intervals:**  
- **Initial Verification**  
- **Annual Renewal**  
- **Post-Modification Review**

---

## <a name="field-testing"></a>9. Field Testing (Optional)  
- Rinse-through ethanol screening recommended.  
- Approved enzymatic or spectrometric methods.  
- ATP testing may supplement hygiene assessment.

---

## <a name="documentation--recordkeeping"></a>10. Documentation & Recordkeeping  
- Verification records  
- Identification plan  
- Change log  
- Cleaning log

---

## <a name="tag-serialization--registry"></a>11. Tag Serialization & Registry  
- Serialized tag: DV-SITE-YYYY-#####  
- Registry entry required  
- Public verification via QR/URL encouraged

---

## <a name="roles--responsibilities"></a>12. Roles & Responsibilities
