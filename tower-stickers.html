    <p style="max-width:860px">
      The <strong>DraftVerify Holographic Sticker</strong> is more than a label — it’s a global symbol of integrity for
      non-alcoholic draft service. When guests see this genuine mark on a tap tower, they know what’s in their glass
      is exactly what it claims to be: <strong>non-alcoholic, verified, and served with care</strong>.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:860px">
      Each sticker carries a distinct holographic pattern, security microtext, and a unique serial identifier to
      prevent imitation. It is instantly recognizable — a trusted visual cue for guests and a professional reminder
      for bar teams that non-alcoholic service deserves the same precision and pride as any draft system.

    <div class="kicker">Why It Matters</div>
    <h2 class="h2">A Universal Signal of Care</h2>

    <p style="max-width:860px">
      As non-alcoholic draft options grow worldwide — beer, kombucha, and nitro cold brew — clarity matters.
      The DraftVerify sticker gives both operators and guests instant assurance that a tap has been properly designated
      and separated from alcoholic service.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:860px">
      For operators, it simplifies training: new staff learn that <em>the hologram means non-alcoholic</em>.  
      For guests, it builds trust and removes hesitation — a moment of certainty in a world where “just a sip”
      isn’t always safe or acceptable.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:26px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Guest Confidence</h3>
        <p>Helps guests order freely, knowing the tap is safe and certified for non-alcoholic use.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Staff Clarity</h3>
        <p>One look tells staff they’re handling a non-alcoholic line — no guessing, no mistakes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Brand Integrity</h3>
        <p>Operators who display the hologram show commitment to transparency and guest safety — the foundation of trust.</p>

    <div class="kicker">The Genuine Mark</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Designed for Global Recognition</h2>

    <p style="max-width:860px">
      The holographic sticker is intentionally hard to reproduce and impossible to mistake. Its layered metallic finish
      and color-shifting patterns make it visible under bar lighting, even from a distance.
    </p>

    <ul style="max-width:860px; line-height:1.8">
      <li><strong>Holographic Prism Layer:</strong> catches and reflects light, creating the unmistakable DraftVerify shine.</li>
      <li><strong>Microtext & Serial Code:</strong> each genuine sticker is numbered and traceable to its issuing batch.</li>
      <li><strong>Tamper-Resistant Adhesive:</strong> cannot be removed intact — protecting authenticity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="max-width:860px">
      Only authorized distributors and venues receive genuine DraftVerify tower stickers as part of their onboarding kit.
      Copies and reprints are strictly prohibited — because trust only works when the mark is real.

    <p style="max-width:860px">
      The holographic sticker is applied directly to the tap tower near the faucet, facing both staff and guests.
      It should be visible during every pour — catching light and attention at the exact moment it matters most.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:26px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Operator-Facing</h3>
        <p>Acts as a quick visual confirmation before serving. Staff instantly know which line is non-alcoholic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Guest-Facing</h3>
        <p>Invites confidence and conversation — a visible mark that says “this pour is different.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Brand Cohesion</h3>
        <p>Each hologram reinforces the same global message: DraftVerify means verified, safe, and respected NA service.</p>
