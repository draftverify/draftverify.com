      <h1>DraftVerify — The Global Standard for Non-Alcoholic Draft</h1>
      <p>
        DraftVerify combines a simple, physical identification system with a digital verification layer for non-alcoholic draft.  
        The NA keg, the NA line, and the NA faucet are clearly marked on the front end — while checks, changes, and line status can be tracked and reviewed on the back end.

<!-- WHAT & WHY -->
<section class="section center" id="why">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker">What &amp; Why</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Clarity at the Tap. Traceability Behind It.</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic draft needs more than a label on a faucet. Teams must know exactly which line is NA — and breweries increasingly need proof of how those lines are set up and maintained.  
      DraftVerify solves both: a unified visual mark from keg to faucet, and a digital trail that can track verification checks, line changes, and NA draft setups over time.
    </p>

<!-- THE TECHNOLOGY -->
<section class="section" id="technology">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker center">The Technology</div>
    <h2 class="h2 center">Identification in the Cooler. Data in the Cloud.</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      DraftVerify is more than a sticker kit. It is a visual standard backed by a digital verification layer that can log, track, and surface what’s happening on NA lines — from the first install to the latest keg change.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:32px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Tagged Lines with IDs</h3>
        <p>
          Every DraftVerify marker — from the keg tag to the tower sticker — can be associated with a unique ID.  
          This allows venues and breweries to tie real-world hardware to digital records for each NA line.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Verification & Event Logging</h3>
        <p>
          When a line is checked, a keg is changed, or a setup is verified, those events can be logged through a simple web or mobile flow.  
          Over time, this builds a history of actions on each NA line, venue by venue.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Trackable Line History</h3>
        <p>
          The result is a traceable record: which keg was on which line, when it was connected, and when it was last confirmed.  
          Breweries and groups gain visibility beyond the tap wall for their NA programs.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Built for Dashboards & Reporting</h3>
        <p>
          Because the system is ID-based and digital-ready, it can feed venue and group dashboards — showing how many lines are active, when they were last verified, and where NA draft is being poured.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Simple for Staff, Powerful for Ops</h3>
        <p>
          Front of house teams only see clear tags and a short checklist.  
          Behind the scenes, operators and breweries can review logs, spot gaps, and standardize how NA draft is managed across locations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Scales with Your Network</h3>
        <p>
          As more venues adopt DraftVerify, the same IDs, checks, and workflows apply everywhere — creating a consistent, scalable framework for NA draft trackability and traceability.

    <h2 class="h2">Identification → Verification → Training</h2>
    <p>Three straightforward pieces that connect what guests see to what operators can track.</p>

        <h3>Make It Obvious</h3>
        <p>
          DraftVerify tags the <strong>NA keg</strong>, marks the <strong>NA line</strong>, and labels the <strong>NA faucet</strong>.  
          For staff, it’s a single, unified look that makes the correct line easy to follow.

        <h3>The Venue Check — With a Record</h3>
        <p>
          A quick venue-led check confirms the tagged keg connects to the tagged line and marked faucet.  
          Those checks can be logged digitally, creating a lightweight record of when lines were last confirmed.
