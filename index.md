      <h1>DraftVerify — The Global Standard for Non-Alcoholic Draft</h1>
      <p>
        DraftVerify unifies a simple, physical identification system with a digital verification layer for non-alcoholic draft.  
        On the front end, the NA keg, the NA line, and the NA faucet are clearly marked. On the back end, checks, changes, and line status can be tracked, reviewed, and standardized across venues.

<!-- WHAT & WHY -->

    <div class="kicker">What &amp; Why</div>
    <h2 class="h2">Clarity at the Tap. Traceability Behind It.</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic draft needs more than a sticker on a faucet. Teams must know exactly which line is NA in the moment, and breweries increasingly need visibility into how those lines are installed and maintained.  
      DraftVerify solves both: a unified visual mark from keg to faucet, and a digital trail that can track verification checks, line changes, and NA draft setups over time.
    </p>

<!-- WHY TRACKABILITY MATTERS -->
<section class="section" id="why-trackability">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="kicker center">Why Trackability Matters</div>
    <h2 class="h2 center">From “We Think” to “We Know”.</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      In real service, lines get swapped, new staff learn the keg room on the fly, and multi-site groups try to keep standards aligned. Without a shared system, NA draft service is built on memory and verbal hand-offs.
    </p>
    <ul style="max-width:820px;margin:16px auto 0;line-height:1.7">
      <li>Line swaps during rushes can quietly break NA draft intentions.</li>
      <li>New team members rarely know the keg room layout on day one.</li>
      <li>Multi-site groups struggle to keep “how we handle NA draft” consistent.</li>
      <li>Breweries want to know how and where their NA beer is actually poured.</li>
      <li>NA guests are trusting the system, not just the tap handle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:18px auto 0;">
      DraftVerify turns these unknowns into something you can see, track, and improve.

    <h2 class="h2 center">Trackability &amp; Traceability Built In.</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      DraftVerify is more than a physical standard. Each NA draft line can be associated with a unique identifier, so verification checks, keg changes, and line status can be logged through a simple web or mobile flow — building a traceable history for every NA line, venue by venue.

        <h3>Unique Line IDs</h3>
        <p>
          Every DraftVerify marker — from the keg tag to the tower sticker — can be tied to a line ID.  
          This links the physical hardware in the cooler and on the tower to a digital record in the system.

        <h3>Verification &amp; Event Logs</h3>
        <p>
          When a line is checked, a keg is changed, or a setup is verified, those events can be logged in seconds.  
          Over time, this builds a history of actions on each NA line, creating real traceability.

        <h3>Venue &amp; Group Visibility</h3>
        <p>
          Operators and brewery partners gain a clear view of where NA draft is installed, how lines are configured, and when they were last confirmed — across one venue or a whole network.

    <div class="kicker center">The Technology</div>
    <h2 class="h2 center">Identification in the Cooler. Data in the Cloud.</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      DraftVerify blends physical clarity with digital insight. The NA keg, the NA line, and the NA faucet share a single look on the floor — while in the background, those same identifiers can power dashboards, reports, and standardized workflows.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:32px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>A Unified System</h3>
        <p>
          DraftVerify synchronizes three markers — the keg tag, the line marker, and the tower sticker.  
          Together, they create an unmistakable path from keg → line → faucet that staff can follow instantly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Engineered for Service</h3>
        <p>
          The system borrows principles from industrial safety, food service, and beverage operations, then distills them into a simple visual language that fits into existing draft setups — no specialized hardware required.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Ready for Dashboards &amp; APIs</h3>
        <p>
          Because the system is ID-based and digital-ready, it can feed venue and group dashboards, support reporting, and eventually integrate with other operational tools as NA draft programs scale.

    <p>A simple framework that connects what guests see at the faucet to what operators can track in the background.</p>

        <p>
          DraftVerify tags the <strong>NA keg</strong>, marks the <strong>NA line</strong>, and labels the <strong>NA faucet</strong>.  
          For staff, it’s a single, unified look that makes the correct line easy to follow.

          A quick venue-led check confirms the tagged keg connects to the tagged line and marked faucet.  
          When paired with the digital layer, those checks can be logged, creating a lightweight record of when lines were last confirmed.
