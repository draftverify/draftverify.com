# DraftVerify  
### **The Global Standard for Non-Alcoholic Draft**

DraftVerify is the contamination-prevention and identification standard that guarantees NA beer is always poured safely, correctly, and exactly as the brewery intended.

With one consistent look at the keg, along the beer line, and on the tower, teams can trace the right line in seconds — and guests can order with confidence.

## What & Why  
### **Clarity for Teams. Confidence for Guests.**

DraftVerify is the global identification and verification standard for non-alcoholic draft.  
It removes guesswork during busy service by providing a clear, recognizable mark from the cooler to the faucet — ensuring the pour a guest chooses is truly non-alcoholic.

---

## Why NA Draft Needs a Global Standard  
Non-alcoholic beer cannot share lines, couplers, or towers with alcoholic products — even trace contamination breaks guest trust and creates brand risk.

DraftVerify defines the universal identification and verification protocol that breweries and venues can rely on:

- Clear, consistent identification  
- Verified keg → line → faucet alignment  
- Safe, correct, contamination-free pours  
- Simple training teams follow across shifts  

This is why DraftVerify exists — and why it is becoming the global standard.

## How It Works  
### Identification → Verification → Training
