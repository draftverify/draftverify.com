      <h1>DraftVerify — The Global Standard for Non-Alcoholic Draft</h1>
      <p>
        DraftVerify is the identification and contamination-prevention standard for non-alcoholic draft — providing a consistent visual path from keg to line to faucet so teams and guests can trust the pour.  
        With one recognizable look at the keg, along the beer line, and on the tower, teams can trace the right line in seconds, even in the middle of busy service.

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      DraftVerify is the global identification and verification standard for non-alcoholic draft.  
      It removes guesswork during busy service by providing a clear, recognizable mark from the cooler to the faucet — so teams know exactly which lines are NA, and guests can order with confidence.

    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      Non-alcoholic beer cannot share lines, couplers, or towers with alcoholic products — even trace contamination can break guest trust and create brand risk.  
      Until now, there has been no unified way to identify and manage NA draft across venues and groups.

    <h2 class="h2 center">What DraftVerify Is — and How It Works</h2>
    <p style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      DraftVerify is the first unified identification and verification framework built specifically for non-alcoholic draft.  
      It blends simple physical markers, digital-ready workflows, and a universal visual language to create a clear, repeatable standard for NA service in any venue.
    </p>

    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:32px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>A Unified System</h3>
        <p>
          At the heart of DraftVerify is a synchronized trio of markers: the keg tag, the line marker, and the tower sticker.  
          Each element matches visually, forming a single, unmistakable path from the cooler to the faucet.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Engineered for Clarity</h3>
        <p>
          DraftVerify takes principles used in industrial safety, food handling, and beverage compliance and translates them into a simple system bar teams can apply in seconds.  
          No specialized equipment. No new hardware. Just clear, universal cues that fit into existing draft setups.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Digital Verification Ready</h3>
        <p>
          Each DraftVerify identifier can be paired with venue-led logging and on-site verification workflows.  
          This makes it possible for venues and breweries to maintain a consistent standard, document checks, and onboard new staff rapidly as programs scale.

        <h3>Zero-Guesswork Pouring</h3>
        <p>
          In fast service environments, DraftVerify cuts through noise — helping ensure the correct NA keg connects to the correct line and faucet.  
          Teams don’t trace hoses or rely on memory; the system tells them exactly what’s non-alcoholic.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Universal Visual Language</h3>
        <p>
          The DraftVerify mark is deliberately simple, recognizable, and consistent.  
          Whether in a high-volume bar or a small taproom, staff quickly learn the symbols — and guests start to recognize the assurance at the faucet.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Built for Expansion</h3>
        <p>
          Because the system is standardized, it scales naturally across multi-site groups, distributors, and brewery partners.  
          DraftVerify becomes the shared language for NA draft service no matter where it’s poured.
