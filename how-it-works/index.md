# How DraftVerify Works
DraftVerify is a physical identification system and digital verification layer that ensures non-alcoholic draft lines remain clearly marked, separated, and verifiable from keg → coupler → line → faucet.

Below is the full deployment journey. No guesswork. No custom build. No complicated onboarding.

---

## 1. Discovery & System Mapping
A venue or brewery begins by sending photos of their cooler, couplers, lines, and tower.  
DraftVerify maps the draft system, identifies NA tap locations, and confirms how tags will be applied.

**Outcome:** A clear system map and recommended tag placement.

---

## 2. Starter Kit Shipment
The venue receives a DraftVerify Starter Kit containing:

- Keg ID Tags  
- Coupler Tags  
- Line Wraps  
- Faucet Badges  
- Tower Stickers (where applicable)  

Tags are standardized according to DraftVerify Standard v1.0.

**Outcome:** Every physical touchpoint in the NA path is now visually identified.

---

## 3. Installation (10–15 minutes)
Staff attach each tag to the mapped locations using the quick-start guide.  
No tools or specialized training required; tags lock into place and stay on during daily operations.

**Outcome:** The NA path is physically separated and obvious to any staff member.

---

## 4. First Verification Event
A staff member performs the first verification using the DraftVerify Registry:

1. Identify the NA tap.  
2. Scan or enter the tag ID.  
3. Confirm keg, coupler, line, and faucet alignment.

**Outcome:** A documented digital record showing the tap is correctly configured.

---

## 5. Daily or Weekly Front-of-House Checks
Staff perform a simple check at the start of each shift:

- Is the keg connected to the correct coupler?
- Are the line tags intact and unbroken?
- Does the faucet match the registered NA tap?

Checks can be logged in under 10 seconds.

**Outcome:** Continuous assurance that the NA tap remains accurate and consistent.

---

## 6. Monthly Verification
A manager or brewery rep performs a full verification cycle.  
This confirms that no accidental cross-connection or mis-pour risk has developed.

**Outcome:** A monthly compliance log stored in the Registry.

---

## 7. Annual Program Review
DraftVerify provides an annual review summarizing:

- Verification history  
- Any mismatches or corrections  
- Tag replacements  
- System changes or upgrades  

**Outcome:** A clear compliance record for internal QA, insurers, and brewery partners.

---

## The Result
DraftVerify gives venues and breweries a simple, standard-driven program they can implement once and trust every day — with a digital audit trail proving that NA lines remain NA.
