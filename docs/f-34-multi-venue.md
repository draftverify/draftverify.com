# Multi-Venue Program Requirements

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

</p>

F-34 defines the required structure, workflows, and governance for organizations operating **multiple venues** under the DraftVerify Standard.  
This includes restaurant groups, stadiums, breweries with multiple taprooms, and hospitality brands with centralized oversight.

The goal is to ensure that **identity, verification, documentation, and safety protocols remain consistent across all sites**, regardless of staffing, volume, or organizational complexity.

## 1. Purpose of the Multi-Venue Program

This document establishes:

- Standardized operations across all participating venues  
- A single governing compliance framework  
- Centralized identity and record management  
- Multi-site verification and audit requirements  
- Rules for cross-location product movement  
- Documentation and training expectations  

Multi-venue organizations must meet **all single-venue requirements** (F-18, F-19, F-22) plus the enhanced controls defined here.

---

## 2. Scope

This program applies to organizations operating:

- 2 or more DraftVerify-certified venues  
- Regional or national chains  
- Stadiums or event centers  
- Multi-building campuses  
- Brewery taproom networks  

It includes requirements for:

- Centralized management  
- Staff training coordination  
- Shared inventory and distribution  
- Unified documentation  
- Multi-site audits  
- Identity tracking across venues  

---

## 3. Core Requirements for Multi-Venue Operators

### 3.1 Central Compliance Owner (CCO)

Each organization must appoint a **Central Compliance Owner** responsible for:

- Oversight of all venue compliance  
- Maintaining training standards  
- Ensuring logs are complete and accurate  
- Serving as audit primary contact  
- Approving product switching procedures  
- Coordinating corrective actions  

The CCO is the **single point of accountability**.

---

### 3.2 Venue Compliance Leads

Each venue must designate a **Venue Compliance Lead (VCL)**.

VCL responsibilities:

- Daily and weekly verification (F-19)  
- Ensuring NA separation and correct tap identity  
- Completing incident reports (F-22)  
- Coordinating with the CCO  
- Making sure verification tools (phones, NFC) are functional  

---

### 3.3 Standardized Identity Configuration

All venues must maintain:

- Consistent Line Tag and Faucet ID layouts (F-8, F-9)  
- Standardized cooler diagrams  
- Standardized NA storage organization  
- Shared naming conventions  
- Unified DTI tracking procedures  

Identity components must always match the DraftVerify Visual Lexicon (F-10).

---

## 4. Product Movement Between Venues

### 4.1 Allowed Only With Identity Integrity

A keg may be transferred between venues **only if**:

- Coupler Tag is intact  
- Collar is intact  
- Verification scan succeeds  
- Audit log confirms prior lifecycle events  
- Product switching protocol (F-39) is followed  

### 4.2 Cross-Venue Documentation

Transfers must include:

- DTI  
- Source venue  
- Destination venue  
- Timestamp  
- Driver or transfer staff identity  
- Pre-transfer scan  
- Post-transfer scan  

### 4.3 Disallowed Transfers

A keg **may not** be moved if:

- Tag fails scan  
- Identity mismatch occurs  
- Collar is damaged  
- Keg identity is under investigation  

---

## 5. Training Requirements

Multi-venue groups must:

- Conduct standardized onboarding training (F-23)  
- Maintain centralized training records  
- Deliver refresher training at least **annually**  
- Re-train after incidents or major procedural updates  
- Certify all Venue Compliance Leads  

Training content must be consistent across locations.

---

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### 6.1 Centralized System
Organizations must maintain a centralized repository for:

- Verification logs (F-19)  
- Incident responses (F-22)  
- Product switching logs (F-39)  
- Activation/serialization tracking (F-12, F-13)  
- Audit logs (F-31)  

### 6.2 Version Control
All documentation must follow:

- Unified versioning  
- Change logs (F-20)  
- Standard formatting  

### 6.3 Minimum Retention
All records must be retained for at least **5 years**.

---

## 7. Multi-Venue Audit Requirements

Multi-venue operators undergo:

### 7.1 Central Audit
Evaluates:

- Training  
- Documentation  
- Identity consistency  
- Corrective action processes  

### 7.2 Randomized Venue Spot Audits
Multiple locations are selected at random and inspected using F-37.

### 7.3 Annual Certification Audit
Required for certification renewal (F-32).

### 7.4 Audit Failure Conditions
Multi-venue certification may be suspended if:

- Multiple venues fail audits  
- Training gaps are discovered  
- Systemic identity issues appear  
- NA separation breaks down at scale  

---

## 8. Technology & System Requirements

Multi-venue operators must:

- Use a unified login and permissions system  
- Ensure all venues have NFC-capable devices  
- Maintain consistent scanning apps/tools  
- Centralize reporting dashboards  
- Use the same cooler diagrams and system maps  

Where applicable, operators may integrate:

- POS flags for NA draft  
- Internal compliance dashboards  
- Inventory-tracking integrations  

---

## 9. Incident Escalation Model

Incidents follow the escalation hierarchy:

1. **Staff Member**  
2. **Venue Compliance Lead**  
3. **Central Compliance Owner**  
4. **DraftVerify Auditor (if required)**  

Serious incidents (mis-serve, tag tampering, failed verification) automatically trigger a **Special Audit** (F-33).

---

## 10. Summary

F-34 provides the framework for **scalable, consistent, and auditable** DraftVerify implementation across multi-venue organizations.

It ensures:

- Unified identity standards  
- Consistent verification workflows  
- Trained staff at every location  
- Reliable documentation and traceability  
- Clear accountability structures  
- Safe and accurate NA draft service across all venues  

Multi-venue groups must meet **every requirement of the single-venue standard** and the **additional centralized controls** defined here.
