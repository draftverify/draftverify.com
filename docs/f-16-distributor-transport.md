# Distributor Transport & Storage Requirements

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active  
<br>© 2025 DraftVerify™ Standards Initiative. All rights reserved.
</p>

This Standard defines the **mandatory storage, cold-chain, segregation, and transport rules** required for distributors handling non-alcoholic (NA) draft kegs under DraftVerify.

Transport and storage are the highest-risk points for:

- Tag damage  
- Identity loss  
- Mis-stacking  
- NA/alcoholic cross-contamination  
- Temperature excursions  
- Chain-of-custody failures  

F-16 ensures that DraftVerify identity survives the entire distribution lifecycle.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of F-16 is to ensure:

- NA kegs remain correctly identified  
- Coupler Tags remain intact and scannable  
- Transport does not compromise tag durability  
- Temperature remains within safe beverage parameters  
- NA/alcoholic separation is preserved end-to-end  
- Warehouse procedures uphold identity integrity  

This protects venues, breweries, consumers, and distributors.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to:

- Distribution warehouses  
- Cold storage facilities  
- Delivery vehicles  
- 3PL partners  
- Cross-dock operations  
- Any handler moving NA draft kegs  

Covered responsibilities include:

- Storage setup  
- Cold-chain management  
- Segregation rules  
- Transport configuration  
- Stability and movement control  
- Tag visibility during handling  
- Incident response  

---

## 3. Storage Requirements

### 3.1 NA-Only Storage Zones (Mandatory)

Every distributor must maintain **dedicated NA storage zones**, either:

- A fully separate room, **or**  
- A physically segregated area with dividers/pallets  

Requirements:

- Clearly labeled “NON-ALCOHOLIC ONLY” signage  
- No alcoholic product stored above, below, or beside NA product  
- No mixed pallets  

### 3.2 Stacking Requirements

Kegs must be stacked so that:

- Coupler Tags are not crushed  
- Zip ties cannot snag  
- Tags remain visible when possible  
- Sidewall NA bands (if used) remain viewable  

Tag safety overrides pallet efficiency.

### 3.3 Temperature Requirements

Distributors must maintain:

- Cold storage consistent with brewery specifications  
- Stability during opening/closing cycles  
- Logs showing temperature consistency (recommended)  

Tags must withstand cold-chain conditions, but excessive freeze/thaw cycling may weaken adhesives or ties.

---

## 4. Warehouse Handling Requirements

### 4.1 Forklift & Pallet Jack Movement

Operators must:

- Avoid scooping pallets underneath tag areas  
- Never drag kegs across floors  
- Avoid pinching or crushing coupler areas  

### 4.2 Visibility During Handling

Handlers must:

- Keep the Coupler Tag facing outward during new placement  
- Avoid orienting tags downward where they cannot be inspected  

### 4.3 Tag Integrity Checks

During movement, staff must check:

- Zip tie intact and tight  
- Tag unmoved and unrotated  
- No tear, bend, or adhesive failure  

If a tag is damaged:

**Keg must be quarantined.**

---

## 5. Pre-Transport Procedures

Before loading kegs:

### 5.1 Verification Scan (Mandatory)

Every NA keg must be scanned to confirm:

- Correct product identity  
- Activation status  
- No mismatched tag or inactive DTI  

### 5.2 Load Mapping

Distributors must record:

- Products and quantities  
- Batch or fill dates (if provided)  
- Destination venues  
- Vehicle route  
- Driver identity  

### 5.3 Vehicle Preparation

Vehicles must:

- Be free of alcoholic product near NA cargo  
- Have clean loading surfaces  
- Be pre-chilled when required  
- Feature internal barriers to prevent keg movement  

---

## 6. Transport Requirements

### 6.1 NA/Alcoholic Separation (Mandatory)

During transport:

- NA kegs must be stored in their own zone  
- No alcoholic products may contact or stack above NA products  
- If mixed loads are unavoidable → **hard physical barriers are required**  

Separation prevents:

- Product mix-ups  
- Mis-delivery  
- Brand contamination  
- Compliance failures  

### 6.2 Stability & Movement Control

Kegs must be secured using:

- Load bars  
- Straps  
- Chocks  
- Tight pallet shrink  

They must not:

- Roll freely  
- Tip over  
- Rub against metal surfaces  
- Hit rear or side doors  

### 6.3 Environmental Protection

Drivers must:

- Avoid prolonged exposure to heat  
- Keep doors closed between stops  
- Protect tags from rain or impact  
- Report any temperature excursion (if monitored)  

---

## 7. Delivery Handling

### 7.1 Unloading Requirements

During unloading:

- Tags must remain visible  
- Drivers must avoid grabbing kegs by the coupler  
- No keg may be rolled on its top surface  

### 7.2 Venue Delivery Conditions

If the venue’s storage conditions compromise:

- Tag visibility  
- NA separation  
- Temperature  

The driver must notify the venue and distributor supervisor.

### 7.3 Mandatory Delivery Scan

Driver scans each keg with venue staff, confirming:

- Correct identity  
- Active DTI  
- Correct NA categorization  
- No damage since leaving warehouse  

---

## 8. Incident Management in Transport

### 8.1 Examples of Incidents

- Tag ripped off  
- Tag rotated or loosened  
- Zip tie broken  
- Keg tipped and rolled  
- Keg exposed to extreme heat  
- Mixed stacking with alcoholic kegs  
- Delivery of wrong SKU  

### 8.2 Required Actions

For any incident:

- Stop delivery of affected keg  
- Quarantine keg  
- Document incident  
- Notify brewery and DraftVerify  
- Replace keg if available  

### 8.3 Vehicle Accident Protocol

If the vehicle is involved in an accident:

- All NA kegs must be quarantined  
- Every tag must be rescanned  
- Structural integrity must be verified  

---

## 9. Distributor Documentation Requirements

Distributors must maintain:

### 9.1 Storage Logs  
- NA zone verification  
- Temperature logs (recommended)  
- Separation compliance checks  

### 9.2 Transport Logs  
- Load list  
- Route map  
- Driver identity  
- Vehicle ID  
- Pre-transport verification scans  

### 9.3 Incident Logs  
Each incident must include:

- Description  
- Location  
- Driver statement  
- Photo evidence (recommended)  
- Action taken  

### 9.4 Audit Readiness  
Documentation must be:

- Accurate  
- Up to date  
- Available upon request  

---

## 10. Training Requirements

Staff must be trained in:

- NA separation rules  
- Tag integrity identification  
- Verification scanning  
- Safe keg handling  
- Warehouse and vehicle loading standards  

Training frequency:

- At onboarding  
- Annually  
- After major Standard revisions  

---

## 11. Compliance Requirements

A distributor is **DraftVerify-compliant** when:

- NA kegs remain separated end-to-end  
- Tags are intact throughout lifecycle  
- Verification scans are completed  
- Documentation is accurate  
- Incidents are reported  
- Delivery scans confirm identity  

Non-compliance may result in:

- Certification suspension  
- Required corrective action  
- Removal from DraftVerify distribution network  

---

## 12. Summary

F-16 ensures that NA kegs are protected from identity loss, physical damage, and cross-contamination during transport and storage.

The Standard establishes:

- Proper warehouse configuration  
- End-to-end NA segregation  
- Cold-chain consistency  
- Transport safety  
- Verification workflows  
- Accountability through documentation  

Distributors uphold the identity chain from brewery to venue, ensuring NA draft arrives safely, accurately, and in full compliance with DraftVerify.
