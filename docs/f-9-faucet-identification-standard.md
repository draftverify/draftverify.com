# Faucet Identification Standard

This standard defines the **mandatory identification system for non-alcoholic draft faucets** in DraftVerify-compliant venues.

The faucet is the **public-facing endpoint** of the NA identity chain.  
Correct faucet identification ensures:

- customers know what they are being served  
- staff can verify NA taps instantly  
- auditors can confirm compliance without entering the cooler  
- towers with mixed alcoholic and NA products remain unambiguous  

This is the final visual checkpoint before a beverage is served.

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of faucet identification is to:

- clearly distinguish NA taps from alcoholic taps  
- prevent mis-pours at the final service point  
- maintain visual consistency across venues  
- provide customer assurance and transparency  
- create a reliable endpoint for the digital verification chain  

Faucet identification is a **mandatory requirement** for DraftVerify compliance.

## 2.0 Required Identification Elements

Every NA faucet must include **all** of the following:

### 2.1 NA Handle Band (Mandatory)
A high-visibility NA Gold (#c7aa4a) band applied around the faucet handle.

Requirements:
- must wrap 360° around handle  
- must remain visible during pouring  
- must not interfere with handle movement  
- must use DraftVerify-approved material  
- must display the NA symbol or text (“NA” or “0.0%”)  

### 2.2 Front-of-House Marker (Mandatory)
A customer-facing marker must be present.

Approved types:
- DraftVerify NA badge (adhesive plate)  
- NA Gold clip-on shield  
- integrated tap handle marker  
- custom brewery NA handle with DraftVerify designation  

Must be:
- visible from at least 2 meters  
- placed above or beside the faucet  
- readable in low-light environments  

### 2.3 Tower Identification Cue (Mandatory for Multi-Product Towers)
If the tower includes alcoholic products:

- tower must include a DraftVerify NA tower marker  
- marker must be placed at eye height  
- marker must be oriented toward customers and staff  

This prevents confusion when towers contain both NA and alcoholic taps.

### 2.4 NFC Faucet Tag (Optional)
If used, the NFC faucet tag must:

- contain a unique UID  
- resolve to the corresponding NA registry entry  
- be placed on the faucet body or shank  
- be invisible to customers but scannable by staff  
- withstand cleaning chemicals and heat  

Physical markers remain mandatory even when NFC is used.

## 3.0 Placement Requirements

### 3.1 Handle Band Placement
The NA handle band must be:

- placed on the **upper half** of the handle  
- above any branding wrap  
- installed straight, without twists  
- added after any tap handle swap  

### 3.2 FOH Marker Placement
The front-facing marker must be:

- aligned horizontally  
- placed within 5 cm of the faucet head  
- not blocked by other handles or tower features  
- visible from the customer’s perspective  

### 3.3 Tower Marker Placement
If required:

- tower marker must be on the front-facing surface  
- placed at or above tap handle height  
- not obstructed by POS materials  

### 3.4 NFC Placement
If NFC is used:

- place on fixed metal portions only  
- avoid moving parts or lever arms  
- do not place on areas scrubbed during cleaning  
- ensure tag orientation supports reading through stainless steel (if applicable)

## 4.0 Durability Requirements

Faucet identification must withstand:

- daily handling  
- cleaning and chemical exposure  
- heat from hot water rinsing  
- condensation and cold crashes  
- friction from tap handle operation  
- customer contact  

Approved materials include:
- polymerized label stock  
- molded plastic  
- anodized aluminum markers  
- high-visibility silicone bands  

All materials must maintain color, adhesive strength, and readability for **1 year**.

## 5.0 Brewery Responsibilities

Breweries may supply tap handles pre-marked with NA indicators.  
Brewery responsibilities include:

- providing NA handle art or wraps  
- specifying the correct faucet identification requirements  
- ensuring distributors and venues receive faucet ID documentation  
- confirming that NA handles cannot be mistaken for alcoholic handles  

Breweries may not ship NA products for draft service without required faucet ID instructions.

<!-- SECTION 6 -->

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Venue Responsibilities

Venues must:

- apply NA handle bands on *every* NA faucet  
- maintain FOH markers in clean, readable condition  
- confirm tower markers remain in place  
- inspect faucet ID during keg changes  
- replace missing or damaged identification immediately  
- ensure cleaning crews do not remove or relocate markers  

Failure to maintain faucet identification results in non-compliance with DraftVerify Standard v1.0.
