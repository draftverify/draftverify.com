The Faucet Identification Standard defines the required practices for labeling draft faucets so that customers, bartenders, managers, and inspectors can quickly and reliably identify what is flowing from each tap.  
This standard brings clarity to the **final point of service**, ensuring the beverage presented to the guest matches the keg, the line, and the verified coupler identity.

Faucet identification supports:
- Product accuracy  
- Safety (especially for non-alcoholic draft)  
- Brand integrity  
- Simplified staff training  
- Faster service with fewer errors  

This document complements the keg, coupler, and line standards (F-7 and F-8), completing the full identity chain.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the Faucet Identification Standard is to establish an easy-to-read, highly consistent system that identifies the beverage served from each faucet through:

- Clear visual labels  
- Category color coding  
- Optional DraftVerify marks  
- Alignment with the line and coupler identifiers  

This ensures that the product a customer receives is always the product advertised.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:
- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Breweries and taprooms  
- Stadiums and arenas  
- Multi-venue draft systems  
- DraftVerify-certified operators  

It covers:
- Faucet labels  
- Placement requirements  
- Category color usage  
- Optional visibility elements  
- Compliance criteria  

This standard does **not** regulate the physical tap handle shape or branding. It defines the **identification layer**, not the mechanical hardware.

---

## 3. Components of the Faucet Identification System

### 3.1 Faucet Marker (Primary Identifier)
A small visual identifier placed at or near the faucet dispensing point. It must display:
- Product name  
- Category color  
- Optional style or sub-style  

This marker provides **immediate clarity** for bartenders and guests.

### 3.2 Tap Handle Branding (Optional)
Breweries may provide branded handles, provided they:
- Match the actual product on tap  
- Do not contradict or obscure the faucet marker  

Tap handles are optional and separate from compliance.

### 3.3 Tower Label Row (Optional)
For bars with large multi-tap towers:
- A label strip or plate may be used  
- Each faucet must still have its own clear product marker  
- Layouts must match the real faucet order  

---

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Primary Placement
Faucet markers must be:
- Placed directly on the faucet collar, tower face, or an equivalent location  
- Clearly visible to bartenders and guests  
- Positioned so that visibility is not obstructed by glassware, tap handles, or POS systems  

### 4.2 Orientation
Markers must:
- Face outward toward service  
- Be aligned directly with the correct faucet  
- Match the exact faucet position (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)  

### 4.3 Proximity to Service Point
Faucet markers should be:
- Within 5–15 cm of the faucet head  
- Not placed so low that they are covered by drip trays or glass rinsers  
- Not placed so high that they create confusion with adjacent taps  

---

## 5. Identification Hierarchy

Every faucet must match the chain of identity:

1. **Line Tag** (product running through line)  
2. **Coupler Tag** (verified digital identity)  
3. **Faucet Marker** (final service confirmation)  

If the faucet marker and the verified coupler identity do not match, the system is considered **non-compliant**.

---

## 6. Category Color Coding (Service-Side)

The faucet marker must follow the DraftVerify category color system:

| Category | Color | Requirement |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Non-Alcoholic (NA) | Gold | Mandatory |
| Alcoholic | Blue | Recommended |
| Seasonal / Rotational | Teal | Optional |
| House / Staff | Grey | Optional |

The faucet is the **customer-facing layer**, making category clarity essential.

---

## 7. Accessibility & Readability

Faucet markers must be:
- Large enough to be read from typical service distance  
- High-contrast with clear typography  
- Resistant to moisture, steam, cleaning chemicals, and abrasion  
- Made from plastic, laminated paper, metal tags, or any durable material  

Fonts do not need to be standardized, but readability is required.

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

### 8.1 Breweries
- Provide accurate faucet label information  
- Ensure product names match keg and line assignments  
- Provide category color if supplying branded materials  

### 8.2 Distributors
- Ensure faucets match delivered product  
- Report mismatches between kegs and faucet identity  
- Support venues during line changes  

### 8.3 Venues
- Maintain accurate faucet labeling  
- Update faucet markers immediately when products rotate  
- Remove or replace outdated labels  
- Ensure faucet markers match:
  - The keg  
  - The line tag  
  - The coupler identity  

---

## 9. Compliance Requirements

A venue is considered **F-9 compliant** when:
- Every faucet has a correct and visible faucet marker  
- NA products use gold category coloring  
- The faucet marker, line tag, and coupler identity all match  
- Markers are in correct left-to-right order  
- Outdated labels are removed immediately  
- Staff can identify any faucet within two seconds  

---

## 10. Rationale

Correct faucet identification solves:
- Wrong product being poured  
- NA/alcoholic mix-ups  
- Brand misrepresentation  
- Staff confusion during busy hours  
- Errors caused by rotating taps and new staff  

The faucet is the last step in the chain — and the most visible one.

DraftVerify standardizes this final step to complete the entire identity system.

---

## 11. Summary

The Faucet Identification Standard ensures that every faucet:
- Is clearly labeled  
- Matches the keg and line identity  
- Supports category clarity (especially NA)  
- Provides instant service-side accuracy  
- Strengthens brand trust and consumer safety  

When combined with coupler verification (F-7) and line identification (F-8), this standard creates a complete, end-to-end identity system for modern draft beverage programs.
