F-19 provides a **standardized, auditable checklist** for venues serving non-alcoholic (NA) draft.  
This checklist is designed to:

- Prevent mis-taps  
- Maintain NA identity and separation  
- Ensure verification practices remain consistent  
- Document compliance for audits and incident review  

This is the venue’s **front-line operational tool**, used daily and weekly.

## 1. Purpose of the Checklist

The checklist ensures:

- Correct NA keg is connected  
- Verification scans occur on schedule  
- Identification components remain intact  
- Cooler and tower organization meet DraftVerify standards  
- Issues are documented and escalated appropriately  

This serves both as a **compliance document** and a **training reinforcement tool**.

## 2. How to Use This Checklist

- Complete **Daily Checklist** every day before service.  
- Complete **Weekly Checklist** every 7 days.  
- Keep all completed checklists in venue records for at least **12 months**.  
- Provide logs during audits (F-33) or incident investigations (F-22).
