This document defines the **engineering, layout, and operational design requirements** for draft beverage systems serving **non-alcoholic (NA)** products under the DraftVerify Standard.

NA draft introduces unique identity, contamination, and compliance risks.  
These requirements ensure that system design supports:

- Correct product identity  
- NA separation  
- Cleaning accessibility  
- Safe operational conditions  
- Compatibility with the DraftVerify identity chain  

F-24 does **not** replace local engineering or safety codes — it supplements them with NA-specific identity and operational safeguards.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this standard is to:

- Establish uniform design expectations for NA draft service  
- Ensure system layouts support DraftVerify tagging and verification  
- Prevent cross-connection or accidental NA ↔ alcoholic mixing  
- Reduce mis-serve risk through physical and operational design  
- Improve auditability and traceability throughout the system  
- Support maintenance, cleaning, and line switching protocols  

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

- Bars, restaurants, taprooms  
- Stadiums and high-volume venues  
- Breweries with service systems  
- Multi-venue chains  
- Draft system installers and technicians  

Covers:

- Cooler layout & kegroom organization  
- Line routing & identification  
- Tower design requirements  
- Hardware compatibility  
- Gas system configuration  
- Workflow and access considerations  
- Identity support infrastructure (tags, labels, signage)  

---

## 3. System Architecture Requirements

### 3.1 Dedicated NA Pathway  
Every NA draft system must maintain a **clearly defined pathway**:

**Keg → Coupler → Beverage Line → Tower → Faucet**

At no point may the NA pathway be temporarily or permanently connected to:

- Alcoholic product  
- Cleaning reservoir without proper sanitization  
- Reassigned lines without documentation (see F-39)

### 3.2 Physical Layout  
System design must allow:

- Clear visibility of keg collars  
- Easy access to coupler tags for NFC scanning  
- Stable positioning that prevents tag damage  

### 3.3 Technician Access  
Installers must ensure:

- Full access to couplers for scanning  
- Safe access to line tags  
- Service clearance for faucet disassembly  
- Adequate lighting in the kegroom  

---

## 4. Cooler & Kegroom Requirements

### 4.1 NA Separation Zone  
Kegs must be stored in:

- A dedicated NA-only rack **or**  
- A physically separated zone with signage  

Mixed stacking with alcoholic kegs is **not permitted**.

### 4.2 Identity Visibility  
The following must remain visible:

- Keg collar  
- Coupler tag  
- Sidewall band (if used)

### 4.3 Environmental Requirements  
Design must support:

- Temperatures safe for NFC tag durability  
- Dry, non-abrasive surfaces preventing tag wear  
- Clean floors free from corrosive chemicals  

---

## 5. Line Routing Requirements

### 5.1 Consistency  
Each line must have:

- A clear, uninterrupted route  
- No unnecessary loops or crossings  
- Secure mounting that prevents abrasion  

### 5.2 Line Tag Placement  
Must follow F-8:

- Within first 30–45 cm (12–18 in.) from coupler  
- Readable orientation  
- Clear, fixed attachment  

### 5.3 NA Line Differentiation  
NA lines must use:

- Gold identity color  
- Unique alphanumeric identifier  
- Matching documentation in F-18 venue map  

---

## 6. Tower & Faucet Requirements

### 6.1 Faucet Identification  
Faucets serving NA must:

- Be clearly labeled  
- Use optional DraftVerify tower markers where needed  
- Match the identity chain (keg → line → faucet)

### 6.2 Tower Design  
Must support:

- Adequate spacing to differentiate NA taps  
- Easy visibility of faucet ID  
- No obstruction during service  

### 6.3 High-Volume Venues  
Stadiums or festivals may require:

- Additional signage  
- Redundant labeling  
- Dedicated NA-only towers  

---

## 7. Coupler Requirements

System must allow:

- Secure zip-tie attachment of coupler tags  
- NFC scanning before connection  
- No obstruction from system hardware  
- No rotation or interference caused by coupler design  

Couplers must be compatible with the DraftVerify coupler tag geometry.

---

## 8. Gas System Requirements

### 8.1 Pressure Safety  
CO₂ or blended gas systems must:

- Meet regional pressure vessel standards  
- Be equipped with functional regulators  
- Be maintained according to safety guidelines

### 8.2 NA Compatibility  
Gas systems must not:

- Introduce off-flavors  
- Cross-feed between NA and alcoholic lines  
- Use contaminated or oil-lubricated regulators  

### 8.3 Documentation  
Technicians must record gas system checks in:

- Cleaning Logs (F-21)  
- Service Logs (part of F-18)  

---

## 9. Cleaning System Compatibility

### 9.1 Access for Chemical Cleaning  
System layout must allow:

- Full recirculation cleaning  
- Faucet disassembly  
- Coupler cleaning without removing identity tags  

### 9.2 NA Safety  
Cleaning equipment must:

- Prevent accidental chemical residue in NA lines  
- Indicate clearly which reservoir feeds which lines  

### 9.3 Post-Cleaning Verification  
After cleaning, identity tags must still be:

- Visible  
- Secure  
- Undamaged  

---

## 10. Identity Infrastructure Requirements

### 10.1 NFC Scan Zones  
Design must ensure staff can:

- Access coupler tags without twisting or bending  
- Scan tags in tight cooler spaces  

### 10.2 Signage  
Venues must include:

- NA zone signage  
- NA-only line identification  
- Staff reminders for verification workflow  

### 10.3 Redundant Identity Support  
Optional but recommended:

- Sidewall bands  
- Tower markers  
- Cooler maps  

---

## 11. System Documentation Requirements

Installers must provide:

### 11.1 Line Map (Required)
Document showing:

- Every line’s identity  
- NA vs alcoholic designation  
- Coupler position  
- Tower position  

### 11.2 Installation Report
Includes:

- Date of installation  
- Technician name  
- Components installed  
- Pressure system settings  
- Any custom modifications  

### 11.3 Venue Identity Packet
Delivered to managers and staff:

- Product map  
- Line map  
- Verification workflow  
- Coupler tag overview  

---

## 12. Compliance Requirements

A system is DraftVerify-compliant when:

- NA lines are physically separated  
- Identity chain supports scanning & visibility  
- Cleaning is compatible with tag retention  
- Tower design avoids mis-identification  
- Documentation is complete  
- Staff can follow verification workflow without obstruction  

Non-compliant system design may:

- Fail DraftVerify audits  
- Trigger reinstallation requirements  
- Increase mis-serve risk  

---

## 13. Summary

The System Design Requirements ensure:

- Safe, reliable NA draft service  
- Physical and visual identity integrity  
- Compliance with DraftVerify verification workflows  
- Reduced risk of cross-contamination  
- Clear lines, clean layouts, and predictable operation  

System design is the foundation of NA draft safety — and the DraftVerify Standard provides the structure for doing it right.
