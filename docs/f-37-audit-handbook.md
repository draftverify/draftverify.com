F-37 provides a complete operational framework for conducting **DraftVerify field audits** across breweries, distributors, and venues.  
The purpose of this handbook is to ensure **uniform scoring**, **consistent inspection criteria**, and **high-fidelity traceability** across all participating parties.

Field audits validate compliance, identify risk, and ensure that NA draft remains safe, separated, and correctly identified throughout the supply chain.

---

## 1. Purpose of Field Audits

Field audits ensure:

- Correct physical identification (F-6, F-7, F-8, F-9)  
- NA separation across the supply chain  
- Verification workflows are being followed (F-18, F-23, F-29)  
- Activation, registry, and traceability integrity (F-12, F-13, F-28, F-31)  
- Safe operating conditions  
- Documentation accuracy  
- Continuous improvement  

Audits provide the **evidence backbone** for DraftVerify certification.

---

## 2. Audit Types

### 2.1 Routine Audit  
Scheduled annual or semi-annual inspection.

### 2.2 Spot Audit  
Unannounced inspection triggered by:

- Incident or contamination report (F-22, F-35)  
- Distributor or brewery escalation  
- Consumer complaint  

### 2.3 Pre-Certification Audit  
Performed before a brewery, distributor, or venue may use the DraftVerify Mark (F-32).

### 2.4 Corrective Action Audit  
Focused review to validate remediation after a failure.

---

## 3. Audit Preparation

Auditor must gather:

- Facility profile  
- Last audit score (if applicable)  
- Registry mapping (F-28)  
- Activation logs (F-13)  
- Verification event logs (F-30)  
- Previous discrepancy reports  

Equipment required:

- NFC-enabled device  
- PPE for cooler/tower areas  
- Digital audit form  
- Access to F-6 through F-40 standards  

---

## 4. Audit Sections & Criteria

Audits are divided into **six scoring sections**, each with mandatory checkpoints.

---

### 4.1 Section A — Identity Integrity (Highest Weight)

Checks include:

- Coupler Tags intact, readable, zip-tied correctly  
- Line Tags present and placed per F-8  
- Tower markers accurate (if used)  
- Faucet IDs match system map  
- Verification URLs resolve correctly  

**Failure:** Any missing or mismatched NA identity element.

---

### 4.2 Section B — NA Separation & Storage

Verifies:

- NA kegs segregated from alcoholic kegs  
- Cooler map present and accurate  
- No mixed stacking or mixed pallets  
- Sidewall ID (if used) intact  

**Failure:** NA keg stored in mixed cooler cluster.

---

### 4.3 Section C — Verification Workflow Compliance

Inspects:

- Staff scanning before tapping  
- Scan history matches keg rotation  
- Venue logbook updated (F-19)  
- Switching procedure followed (F-39)  

**Failure:** Staff cannot demonstrate scanning workflow.

---

### 4.4 Section D — Mechanical & Draft System Condition

Includes:

- Couplers functioning correctly  
- No leaks, foaming, pressure failure  
- Faucets maintained properly  
- Gas system meets F-26 requirements  
- Lines free of residue or odor  

**Failure:** Any mechanical condition affecting product safety.

---

### 4.5 Section E — Cleaning & Maintenance Compliance

Checks against:

- Cleaning Log SOP (F-21)  
- Proper chemical dilution  
- Required rinse cycles  
- Tower and faucet disassembly schedule  

**Failure:** Missing cleaning logs or incomplete cycles.

---

### 4.6 Section F — Documentation & Traceability

Verifies:

- All DTIs accounted for  
- Activation logs match Registry  
- Distributor delivery logs correct  
- Incident records (if any) present  

**Failure:** Any DTI unaccounted for or inconsistent with registry.

---

## 5. Audit Scoring System

Each section scored 0–5:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **5** | Full compliance, zero deficiencies |
| **4** | Minor issues, no safety/identity risk |
| **3** | Moderate issues, corrective action required |
| **2** | Significant compliance gaps |
| **1** | Major failure; critical risk |
| **0** | Non-compliant; immediate shutdown for NA service |

### 5.1 Overall Rating  
Total score (out of 30):

- **27–30** → Certified  
- **22–26** → Certified with minor corrective actions  
- **16–21** → Conditional certification; re-audit required  
- **0–15** → Not certified; NA draft service must cease  

---

## 6. Corrective Action Workflow

If deficiencies are found:

### Step 1 — Issue Report  
Auditor completes the Corrective Action Notice.

### Step 2 — Response Plan  
Facility must submit remediation plan within **7 days**.

### Step 3 — Implementation  
Changes must be completed within **30 days**.

### Step 4 — Verification  
Auditor performs targeted re-inspection.

### Step 5 — Resolution  
Certification restored or withheld based on compliance.

---

## 7. Critical Failure Conditions (Immediate Shutdown)

The following mandate immediate suspension of NA draft service:

- Wrong keg tapped or served  
- Any alcohol contamination risk  
- Missing or tampered Coupler Tag  
- NA line mapped incorrectly  
- Verification URL mismatch  
- Gas system safety hazard  
- Cleaning chemical contamination  
- Any DTI untraceable  

If encountered, the auditor must initiate:

- **F-22 Incident Procedure**  
- **F-35 Contamination Report**  
- Emergency Corrective Action Path  

---

## 8. Documentation Requirements for Auditors

Auditors must keep:

- Full audit form  
- Photo evidence  
- Verification scan logs  
- Notes on interviews with staff  
- Corrective action notices  
- Re-audit results  

Records retained for **10 years**.

---

## 9. Audit Tools & Digital Forms

Auditors use:

- Standardized digital forms  
- NFC scan logs exported for registry integration  
- Automated scoring calculator  
- On-site signature capture  

Future versions will integrate with the DraftVerify mobile auditor app.

---

## 10. Auditor Code of Conduct

Auditors must maintain:

- Neutrality  
- Confidentiality  
- Consistency  
- Accuracy  
- Respect for operations  

They may not accept gifts, compensation, or incentives from facilities.

## 11. Summary

The Field Audit Handbook ensures:

- Reliable, repeatable audits  
- Strong NA identity protection  
- Safe, verified operations  
- High compliance with DraftVerify Standards  
- Traceability and accountability across the supply chain  

Routine and responsive audits reinforce NA safety and trust across the industry.
