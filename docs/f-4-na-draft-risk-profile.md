This document outlines the **full risk landscape** associated with serving non-alcoholic (NA) beverages on draft.  
These risks form the **underlying justification** for the DraftVerify Standard v1.0, supporting the requirement for:
- clear physical identification,  
- strict separation from alcoholic lines, and  
- digital verification of keg → coupler → line → faucet.

<!-- SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1.0 Introduction

Non-alcoholic draft beverages pose **unique risks** that do not exist in traditional alcoholic draft systems.  
These risks come from three areas:

1. **Operational Risk** — staff error, mis-serves, line switching  
2. **Regulatory Risk** — alcohol laws, labeling requirements, consumer protections  
3. **Brand & Consumer Risk** — consumer trust, health concerns, sober population  

Understanding this risk profile explains *why* NA draft requires its own identification and verification standard.

<!-- SECTION 2 — OPERATIONAL RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 2.0 Operational Risk

The most common incidents in mixed draft systems are operational — and they are almost **always unintentional**.

### 2.1 Mis-Serve (Accidental Alcohol Service)
The single highest-risk event.

Occurs when:
- an alcoholic keg is tapped onto an NA line,  
- a faucet is mislabeled,  
- a staff member assumes a line is NA because “it usually is,”  
- tower sharing causes confusion.

### 2.2 Incorrect Line Switching
Happens during:
- keg changeovers  
- mid-shift product rotations  
- events with temporary draft setups  
- shared coolers with many similar-looking kegs  

### 2.3 Staff Turnover
Bars, restaurants, and event venues have high turnover.  
New staff often:

- don't know which lines are NA  
- assume the previous employee routed everything correctly  
- rely on memory or guesswork  

### 2.4 Multi-Vendor Draft Rooms
In large coolers:
- different breweries  
- multiple distributors  
- temporary kegs  
- seasonal rotations  

…create **identity chaos** without a standard.

**DraftVerify eliminates these operational risks** through clear physical ID + a required digital check.

<!-- SECTION 3 — REGULATORY RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3.0 Regulatory Risk

Serving an alcoholic beverage as “non-alcoholic” has regulatory implications.

### 3.1 Licensing Liability
Alcoholic beverages are strictly controlled.  
Mis-serving alcohol to:

- minors  
- sober drivers  
- pregnant individuals  
- people with medical or addiction considerations  

…carries major penalties.

### 3.2 Beverage Labeling Requirements
Draft systems bypass packaging labels.  
Without clear identification:

- consumers cannot confirm the product  
- venues cannot demonstrate compliance  
- breweries face brand exposure  

### 3.3 Insurance Exposure
A mis-serve incident involving alcohol:
- exposes the venue’s liability insurance  
- may result in denied claims  
- is amplified when the guest believed they were consuming NA  


DraftVerify creates a **provable compliance framework** that reduces regulatory and insurance exposure.

<!-- SECTION 4 — BRAND & CONSUMER RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Brand & Consumer Risk

### 4.1 The NA Consumer is a High-Risk Demographic
People choosing NA beverages are often:

- sober by choice  
- sober for health  
- sober for recovery  
- driving  
- pregnant  
- managing medications  

A mis-serve in this demographic is **far more serious** than serving the wrong IPA to a craft beer enthusiast.

### 4.2 Brewery Brand Risk
NA brands rely on:
- trust  
- purity  
- reliability  
- alignment with health-conscious consumers  

A mis-serve — even one — can permanently damage:

- brewery credibility  
- distribution relationships  
- the category’s overall reputation  

### 4.3 Category-Wide Risk
The NA draft category is young.  
A few high-profile mis-serves could:

- slow adoption  
- cause insurers to flag the category  
- create negative press  
- invite unnecessary regulation  

DraftVerify provides the system-level safeguards the category needs to grow responsibly.

<!-- SECTION 5 — ENVIRONMENTAL RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5.0 Environmental & System Risk

### 5.1 Cooler Congestion
Many coolers have:
- mixed alcoholic and NA kegs  
- nearly identical stainless steel formats  
- zero labeling  
- rapid changeovers  

A small mistake becomes a big liability.

### 5.2 Tower Sharing
Most bars use:
- shared beer towers  
- product rotation  
- seasonal taps  

NA product identity is extremely vulnerable without a standard.

### 5.3 Portable Draft Systems
Festivals, catering, and events increase the risks due to:
- temporary hookups  
- staff with little training  
- mixed vendor involvement  
- chaotic keg rooms  

DraftVerify was built to work in every one of these contexts.

<!-- SECTION 6 — RATIONALE FOR THE STANDARD -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Rationale for the DraftVerify Standard

### The core rationale:
**Non-alcoholic draft is the only beverage category where a mis-serve has *both* alcohol liability and sober-consumer risk.**

DraftVerify solves this by creating:
- a clear physical identity path  
- a mandatory digital activation  
- continuous verification  
- audit-proof traceability  

This removes ambiguity, guesswork, and human error from the system.

### Without DraftVerify:
- a keg can be switched once and create dozens of mis-serves  
- a staff assumption becomes a liability event  
- breweries have no control over how their NA beer is poured  
- venues cannot demonstrate compliance or due diligence  

### With DraftVerify:
- identity is permanent  
- continuity is provable  
- errors are detectable  
- verification is logged  
- NA integrity is maintained end-to-end  

The Standard exists because **NA draft requires more rigor**, not less.
