This document defines the **complete risk landscape** associated with non-alcoholic (NA) draft service and explains the justification for the DraftVerify Standard v1.0.  
The risks outlined here form the basis for the mandatory **physical identification**, **digital activation**, and **verification requirements** described throughout the F-Series.

<!-- SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1.0 Introduction

Non-alcoholic draft is the only beverage category where a mis-serve can result in both:

- **alcohol liability**, and  
- **harm to sober or medically restricted consumers**.

These combined risks do **not** exist in alcoholic draft service.

This document outlines the operational, regulatory, consumer, brand, and environmental risks that justify a separate global identification and verification standard.

<!-- SECTION 2 — OPERATIONAL RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 2.0 Operational Risk

Operational errors are the most frequent cause of NA draft failure.

### 2.1 Mis-Serve (Accidental Alcohol Service)
The highest-risk and most common failure event.

Mis-serves occur when:
- an alcoholic keg is connected to an NA line  
- a faucet is mislabeled  
- tower-sharing causes staff confusion  
- a staff member assumes a line is NA “because it usually is”

### 2.2 Incorrect Line Switching
Risks are amplified during:
- keg swaps  
- seasonal product rotations  
- high-volume service periods  
- temporary or mobile draft setups  

### 2.3 High Staff Turnover
Bars and restaurants experience continual turnover.

New staff may:
- not know which lines are NA  
- rely on memory rather than identification  
- skip verification under time pressure

### 2.4 Cooler & Keg Room Congestion
Typical environments include:
- mixed alcoholic and NA kegs  
- nearly identical stainless vessels  
- limited labeling  
- multiple distributors  

Without a standard, identity confusion is predictable.

<!-- SECTION 3 — REGULATORY RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3.0 Regulatory Risk

A mis-serve involving alcohol has regulatory implications.

### 3.1 Licensing & Legal Exposure
Serving alcohol to:
- minors  
- designated drivers  
- pregnant individuals  
- medically restricted guests  

…creates substantial liability.

### 3.2 Labeling & Disclosure Gaps
Packaged NA beverages contain mandatory labeling.  
Draft lines do not.

Without physical identification:
- consumers cannot confirm what they are being served  
- venues cannot demonstrate compliance  
- breweries risk misrepresentation of their NA product

### 3.3 Insurance Risk
Mis-serves involving alcohol:
- create heightened insurance exposure  
- may invalidate claims  
- trigger liability reviews  

DraftVerify provides traceable, provable, auditable compliance.

<!-- SECTION 4 — CONSUMER & BRAND RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Consumer & Brand Risk

### 4.1 High-Risk Consumer Demographics
Many NA drinkers choose NA products for:
- sobriety  
- medical safety  
- pregnancy  
- medication interaction  
- recovery  
- driving  

A mis-serve is significantly more harmful in this demographic.

### 4.2 Brewery Brand Exposure
NA brands depend on:
- trust  
- safety  
- reliability  
- consistency  

A single mis-serve can damage:
- brewery reputation  
- distributor relationships  
- retail trust  
- the entire NA category

### 4.3 Category-Wide Vulnerability
The NA draft category is early-stage.  
High-profile mis-serves could:
- slow adoption  
- increase regulation  
- deter venues  
- damage consumer trust

<!-- SECTION 5 — ENVIRONMENTAL & SYSTEM RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5.0 Environmental & System Risk

### 5.1 Cooler Complexity
Risks increase with:
- mixed kegs  
- fast turnover  
- multi-brewery storage  
- visual similarity  

### 5.2 Tower Sharing
Most bars share tower lines between alcoholic and NA beverages.  
This creates:
- routing confusion  
- line identity ambiguity  
- faucet mislabeling risk  

### 5.3 Temporary & Event Draft Systems
Festivals, mobile bars, and catering introduce:
- untrained staff  
- rapid setup/teardown  
- multi-operator involvement  
- no consistent identification method  

DraftVerify provides a universal system suitable for all environments.

<!-- SECTION 6 — RATIONALE FOR THE STANDARD -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Rationale for the DraftVerify Standard

**NA draft is the only draft category where a mistake has both alcohol liability and sober-consumer harm implications.**

The DraftVerify Standard resolves this by providing:
- a unified physical identity system  
- a required digital activation record  
- continuous verification  
- chain-of-custody traceability  
- auditable compliance  

### Without DraftVerify:
- a single keg switch can produce dozens of mis-serves  
- identity mistakes go undetected  
- breweries lose control of product integrity  
- venues cannot prove compliance after an incident  

### With DraftVerify:
- identity is permanent  
- continuity is verifiable  
- mis-serves become preventable  
- records are audit-ready  
- NA draft integrity is preserved end-to-end
