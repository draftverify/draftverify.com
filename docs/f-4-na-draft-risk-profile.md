This document outlines the **full risk landscape** associated with serving  
non-alcoholic (NA) beverages on draft.

These risks form the **underlying justification** for the DraftVerify Standard  
and the need for continuous identification, separation, and verification  
from keg to faucet.

## 1. Purpose of This Risk Profile

### **1.1 Why This Document Exists**
NA draft introduces risks that **do not exist** for alcoholic draft service.

Traditional alcoholic systems rely on:

- cultural familiarity  
- consistent ABV  
- uniform regulatory expectations  

NA draft, by contrast, carries **distinct safety, legal, operational, and brand risks**  
that require stricter controls.

### **1.2 How This Profile Is Used**
This document informs:

- the identity architecture (F-3)  
- NA separation requirements (F-5)  
- product switching protocol (F-6)  
- physical ID specifications (ID-Series)  
- digital verification requirements (VX-Series)  
- compliance and corrective action (CX-Series)  

It defines the **“why”** behind the DraftVerify Standard.

## 2. Safety & Public Health Risks

### **2.1 Mis-Serve to Minors or Abstainers**
A mis-serve of alcoholic beer **where NA was expected** can involve:

- minors  
- pregnant individuals  
- individuals in recovery  
- designated drivers  
- individuals avoiding alcohol for medical or personal reasons  

Consequences include:

- legal liability  
- health incidents  
- reputational damage  
- regulatory complaints  

### **2.2 Physiological Adverse Reactions**
Even low-level alcohol exposure may risk:

- medication interactions  
- allergic sensitivity  
- adverse health effects  

### **2.3 Cross-Contact During Cleaning or Switching**
If identity is ambiguous, cleaning or switching may:

- introduce alcohol residues into NA lines  
- contaminate NA batches  
- produce inaccurate pours  

This necessitates strict NA → alcoholic pathway separation.

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3. Legal & Regulatory Risks

### **3.1 Age-Restriction Penalties**
Providing alcoholic product to minors—accidentally or otherwise—can result in:

- fines  
- licence suspension  
- legal action  
- civil claims  

### **3.2 Misrepresentation of Alcohol Content**
Serving alcoholic beer under the impression of NA classification can violate:

- consumer protection laws  
- labeling requirements  
- food safety regulations  
- local alcohol service regulations  

### **3.3 Lack of Global NA Draft Standards**
Unlike alcoholic draft (which has long-standing conventions), NA draft has:

- no standardized tagging  
- no common ID rules  
- no global verification layer  
- varying legal definitions across jurisdictions  

DraftVerify resolves this inconsistency.

## 4. Operational Risks

### **4.1 Operator Confusion**
Without clear NA identification:

- bartenders may connect wrong kegs  
- new staff may mis-serve  
- high-turnover environments lose procedural memory  
- similar branding leads to visual confusion  

### **4.2 Multi-Tap / Mixed Systems**
Bars with:

- high-volume draft programs  
- rotating taps  
- seasonal offerings  
- mixed NA/alcoholic towers  

…are especially vulnerable to mislabeling.

### **4.3 Cleaning and Switching Failures**
Operators may:

- reuse alcoholic lines for NA without proper flushing  
- install NA kegs onto alcoholic couplers  
- incorrectly assume a line is dedicated  

These risks justify strict identity rules (ID-Series) and digital activation (VX-Series).

<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5. Brand, Trust & Consumer Expectation Risks

### **5.1 NA Drinkers Expect Zero Confusion**
Consumers ordering NA beverages expect:

- zero alcohol  
- zero ambiguity  
- zero risk of mis-serve  

Any failure can permanently damage:

- brand trust  
- venue credibility  
- brewery integrity  

### **5.2 Breweries Risk Reputational Damage**
If a brewery’s NA beer is mis-served:

- consumers blame the brand—not the venue or distributor  

### **5.3 Negative Social Media Amplification**
A single mis-serve incident can spread:

- virally  
- nationally  
- internationally  

DraftVerify mitigates brand-damaging events.

## 6. Economic Risks

### **6.1 Cost of Liability Events**
Venues may face:

- legal claims  
- PR fallout  
- fines  
- lost business  
- increased insurance scrutiny  

### **6.2 Lost Brewery Sales**
Mis-serve incidents can result in:

- returns  
- recalls  
- dropped accounts  
- loss of NA consumer trust  
- compromised wholesale partnerships  

### **6.3 Waste & Incorrect Keg Taps**
Wrong-keg mistakes lead to:

- product loss  
- wasted inventory  
- inconsistencies

## 7. Rationale for the DraftVerify Standard

DraftVerify mitigates risk by enforcing:

### **Physical Identity**
- collars, coupler tags, line tags, faucet markers  
- standardized placement  
- durability and visibility  

### **Digital Verification**
- NFC signatures  
- registry systems  
- verification events  
- traceability logs  

### **Separation & Control**
- NA-only pathways  
- switching protocols  
- incident tracking  
- operator training  

DraftVerify creates a **repeatable, auditable, and globally consistent**  
approach to NA draft service.

## 8. Relationship to Other Standards

This document is referenced by:

- F-1 — Core Standard  
- F-3 — Identity Architecture  
- F-5 — Separation Standard  
- ID-Series — Physical Specifications  
- VX-Series — Digital Requirements  
- CX-Series — Compliance & Corrective Action  

Where conflicts occur with external regulations,  
**legal requirements override**.
