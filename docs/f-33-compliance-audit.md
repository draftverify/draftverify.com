F-33 defines the **auditing framework** used to evaluate compliance with the DraftVerify Standard across breweries, distributors, and venues.  
The goal is to ensure **identity integrity, safety, traceability, and operational accuracy** throughout the NA draft supply chain.

This framework establishes:

- Audit types  
- Scoring structure  
- Required documentation  
- Field inspection procedures  
- Non-compliance categories  
- Corrective action timelines  

F-33 works in conjunction with F-31 (Audit Log Framework) and F-37 (Field Audit Handbook).

---

## 1. Purpose of the Audit Framework

F-33 provides:

- A consistent evaluation method  
- A measurable compliance score  
- Clear requirements for certification (F-32)  
- Evidence for incident investigation (F-22)  
- Accountability across the entire identity chain  

Audits ensure that DraftVerify remains a **trusted, defensible, and enforceable** standard.

---

## 2. Audit Types

### 2.1 Brewery Audit
Evaluates:

- Serialization accuracy (F-12)  
- Activation workflow (F-13)  
- Physical keg identification (F-6)  
- Documentation completeness (F-14)  
- Correct use of the Mark (F-32)  

### 2.2 Distributor Audit
Evaluates:

- Receiving & verification (F-15, F-17)  
- Transport separation (F-16)  
- Warehouse organization  
- Delivery verification with venues  
- Discrepancy handling  

### 2.3 Venue Audit
Evaluates:

- Correct NA separation  
- Line and faucet identification (F-8, F-9)  
- Daily/weekly checklists (F-19)  
- Tag scanning practices  
- Compliance with product switching protocol (F-39)  

### 2.4 Special Audit
Triggered by:

- Incidents or suspected mis-serves  
- Compliance complaints  
- Significant organizational changes  
- New system installations  

---

## 3. Audit Scoring Structure

Each audit is scored across **five weighted categories**:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Identity Accuracy** | 30% | Tags, labels, and identity mappings must be correct and consistent. |
| **Verification Discipline** | 25% | Required scans and checks must be performed consistently. |
| **Separation Integrity** | 20% | NA must remain separated throughout all workflows. |
| **Documentation & Logs** | 15% | Accurate and complete logs per F-31, F-14, F-17, F-19. |
| **Training & Procedures** | 10% | Staff must know and follow DraftVerify requirements. |

**Passing Score:** 85%  
**Conditional Pass:** 70–84% (requires corrective actions)  
**Fail:** Below 70%

---

## 4. Required Documentation for Audit

Operators must supply:

- Activation logs (F-13)  
- Serialization records (F-12)  
- Distribution logs (F-17)  
- Venue checklists (F-19)  
- Incident reports (F-22)  
- Audit logs (F-31)  
- System diagrams (F-24)  
- Training records (F-23)  

Missing documentation is an automatic deduction.

---

## 5. Field Inspection Procedure

Auditors perform:

### 5.1 Physical Inspection  
- Keg collars  
- Coupler Tags  
- Line Tags  
- Faucet markers  
- Cooler organization  
- Transport racks (for distributors)  

### 5.2 Live Verification Tests  
Auditor may request:

- Live NFC scans  
- Product switching demonstration  
- Identity reconciliation  
- Review of active DTI(s)  

### 5.3 Staff Interviews  
Auditor confirms:

- Understanding of verification workflow  
- NA separation rules  
- Incident escalation steps  

### 5.4 Documentation Review  
Auditor checks:

- Checklist consistency  
- Missing or late entries  
- Evidence of corrective actions  

---

## 6. Non-Compliance Categories

Non-compliance is categorized as:

### **6.1 Critical Non-Compliance (Immediate Failure)**  
Examples:

- Wrong keg tapped → NA mis-serve  
- Missing Coupler Tag  
- Broken NA separation  
- Tampering or falsified records  

Requires immediate corrective action and possible suspension.

### **6.2 Major Non-Compliance**  
Examples:

- Inconsistent verification scans  
- Outdated or missing documentation  
- Incorrect identity mapping  
- Repeated minor issues  

Requires corrective action within 14 days.

### **6.3 Minor Non-Compliance**  
Examples:

- Label wear  
- Temporary cooler organization issues  
- Minor procedural lapses  

Correctable within 30 days.

---

## 7. Corrective Action Requirements

Operators must submit:

- A written corrective action plan  
- Implementation timeline  
- Supporting evidence  
- Follow-up verification scans  

Failure to implement corrective actions may lead to:

- Loss of certification (F-32)  
- Mandatory re-audit  
- Public delisting from DraftVerify registry  

---

## 8. Audit Frequency

### Breweries  
- Annual  
- Additional audits after major system changes  

### Distributors  
- Annual + random spot audits  

### Venues  
- Annual  
- Special audits after incidents or complaints  

### Multi-Venue Groups (F-34)  
- Central audit plus spot checks across sites  

---

## 9. Integration With Other Standards

F-33 is directly linked to:

- **F-31 — Audit Log & Traceability Framework**  
- **F-32 — Certification Policy**  
- **F-37 — Field Audit Handbook**  
- **F-18 — Venue Setup & Verification Protocol**  
- **F-39 — Product Switching Protocol**  

Audits rely on the logs, workflows, and identity structures defined elsewhere.

---

## 10. Summary

F-33 establishes the **official audit structure** used to verify DraftVerify compliance across the full supply chain.  
It ensures:

- Identity integrity  
- NA separation  
- Reliable verification practices  
- Strong documentation and training  
- Accountability at every step  

This framework protects consumers, reinforces standardization, and maintains the credibility of DraftVerify Certification worldwide.
