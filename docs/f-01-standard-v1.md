# DraftVerify Standard v1.0  
**Core Specification for Non-Alcoholic Draft Identity & Verification**

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

</p>

The **DraftVerify Standard v1.0** is the global framework that defines how non-alcoholic (NA) draft beverages must be **identified**, **verified**, **tracked**, and **served** to ensure accuracy, safety, and brand protection.

This document establishes the core rules required for compliance.  
All other standards (F-2 through F-40) derive authority from this document.

---

## 1. Purpose

The DraftVerify Standard exists to:

- Prevent NA → alcoholic mis-serve  
- Provide verifiable identity at every draft system touchpoint  
- Create a unified global system for NA draft handling  
- Reduce liability for breweries, distributors, and venues  
- Enable auditability and digital traceability  
- Standardize physical and digital identification across the industry  

DraftVerify replaces assumptions with **structure, proof, and verification**.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:

- Breweries producing NA draft beverages  
- Distributors transporting NA draft  
- Venues serving NA draft  
- Draft system designers and installers  
- Training organizations using the DraftVerify certification  

This document defines:

- Core identity principles  
- Mandatory physical identifiers  
- Mandatory digital verification  
- Color, labeling, and placement rules  
- Operational requirements  
- Responsibilities for all participating parties  

Referenced documents include:

- **F-2** Definitions & Terminology  
- **F-3** Identity Architecture  
- **F-4** Risk Profile  
- **F-5** Legal Basis  
- **F-6–F-10** Physical ID Standards  
- **F-11–F-40** Operational, distributor, venue, registry, and audit standards  

Where conflicts occur, **F-1 controls**.

## 3. Foundational Principles

DraftVerify is built on five core identity principles:

### 3.1 Identity Must Be Unambiguous  
Every keg, coupler, line, and faucet must clearly state **NA identity**.

### 3.2 Verification Must Occur Before Pour  
The draft system must allow identity confirmation **before connection**, not after a mis-serve.

### 3.3 Physical + Digital Redundancy  
Identity must be reinforced by:

- physical labeling  
- NFC-based digital verification  
- registry-backed identity validation  

### 3.4 NA Must Be Separated From Alcohol  
Line paths, couplers, and labeling must ensure NA cannot be connected to an alcoholic line.

### 3.5 The System Must Be Auditable  
Every identity signal must support:

- investigations  
- compliance auditing  
- corrective actions  
- brand protection  

---

## 4. Physical Identification Requirements

Physical identity standards are defined in:

- **F-6** Keg Identification  
- **F-7** Coupler Tag Standard  
- **F-8** Line Identification  
- **F-9** Faucet Identification  
- **F-10** Visual Lexicon  

Minimum requirements:

### 4.1 Keg Collar  
Must include NA banding, product name, and DraftVerify Tag ID.

### 4.2 Coupler Tag (Mandatory)  
NFC-enabled, uniquely serialized, placed at the engagement point.

### 4.3 Line Tag  
Visible identifier attached within 30–45 cm of the coupler.

### 4.4 Faucet Marker (Optional but recommended)  
Clear visual identification for consumers.

---

## 5. Digital Verification Requirements

The digital architecture is defined in:

- **F-12** NFC Serialization  
- **F-13** Activation Workflow  
- **F-28** Registry Specification  
- **F-29** Tag Activation Rules  
- **F-30** Verification Event Specification  
- **F-31** Audit Log Framework  

Minimum requirements:

### 5.1 Every NA keg must have an active Registry entry  
Including:

- Product  
- Batch  
- Brewery  
- Tag ID  
- Status  

### 5.2 Verification must occur before coupler connection  
Using any NFC-enabled device.

### 5.3 Verification events must be stored in the registry  
Including timestamp and tag identity.

### 5.4 Tags cannot be reused  
Serialized, one-product, one-lifecycle use only.

---

## 6. Separation Requirements

NA draft must be protected by:

- NA-specific pathways  
- Color coding (Gold)  
- Dedicated line identification  
- Clean switching procedures  

See:

- **F-5** Legal Basis  
- **F-25** Tower Sharing Standards  
- **F-39** Product Switching Protocol  

NA may **never** be placed on a line previously used for alcohol without full switching clearance.

---

## 7. Compliance Requirements

To be DraftVerify-compliant, breweries, distributors, and venues must:

### 7.1 Apply all physical identifiers  
Keg, coupler, and line.

### 7.2 Verify identity before tapping  
Scan → confirm → connect.

### 7.3 Maintain accurate registry records  
No missing or mismatched data.

### 7.4 Maintain operational logs  
As defined in F-17, F-19, F-20, F-21.

### 7.5 Retire damaged or unscannable tags  
No exceptions.

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

### 8.1 Breweries  
- Apply collars and coupler tags  
- Activate NFC tags  
- Maintain brewery-side documentation  
- Ship only compliant kegs  

### 8.2 Distributors  
- Protect physical identification  
- Verify accuracy during transport  
- Maintain logs  
- Report mismatches  

### 8.3 Venues  
- Perform scans before tapping  
- Maintain visible identifiers  
- Complete daily/weekly checklists  
- Report incidents immediately  

---

## 9. Enforcement & Certification

DraftVerify compliance programs are defined in:

- **F-32** Certification Policy  
- **F-33** Compliance Audit Framework  

Compliance may include:

- scheduled audits  
- surprise inspections  
- registry reconciliation  
- corrective action requirements  

Certified venues may display the DraftVerify Mark.

Non-compliance may result in:

- suspension  
- decertification  
- removal from registry  
- brewery/distributor notification  

---

## 10. Governance & Updates

Governance structure is defined in:

- **F-40** Revision & Governance Policy  

Updates occur when:

- new risks are identified  
- new technologies become available  
- brewery/venue feedback warrants revision  

All updates to F-1 require formal review and publication by the DraftVerify Standards Initiative.
