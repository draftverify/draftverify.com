## 1. Purpose, Scope, and Status

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the **DraftVerify Standard v1.0** is to provide a clear, repeatable, and verifiable framework for:

- **Identifying** non-alcoholic (NA) draft products and their dedicated pathways  
- **Separating** NA draft systems from alcoholic draft systems to prevent cross-contact  
- **Verifying** the integrity of NA draft service using a combined physical and digital approach  

This Standard exists to make NA draft service **understandable, explainable, auditable, and trusted** by venues, breweries, distributors, staff, and guests.

### 1.2 Scope

This Standard applies to:

- Draft systems serving beverages that are **non-alcoholic by legal definition** in their jurisdiction  
- Mixed draft environments where NA and alcoholic products coexist  
- Dedicated NA draft systems where identity, separation, and traceability still provide value  
- Breweries, distributors, and venues that choose to adopt the DraftVerify system  

It covers:

- Physical identification of kegs, couplers, lines, and faucets used for NA draft  
- Digital registration and activation of NA draft connection points  
- Ongoing verification, recordkeeping, and incident response expectations  

This Standard does **not** cover:

- Packaged product labeling outside of draft service  
- Detailed mechanical design of draft equipment  
- Non-beverage draft systems (e.g., non-food chemical dosing only)  

### 1.3 Status of This Standard

DraftVerify Standard v1.0 is a **voluntary, non-regulatory industry standard**.  
It does **not** replace any applicable:

- food safety laws  
- liquor regulations  
- health codes  
- building or workplace safety requirements  

Operators remain fully responsible for complying with all local, provincial/state, and federal regulations and for ensuring food safety and worker safety in their operations.

The most current version of this Standard is the one published at:  
`https://www.draftverify.com/standards/`

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

This section summarizes foundational terms.  
Full definitions are provided in **F-2 — Definitions, Scope & Terminology**.

- **Non-Alcoholic (NA) Beverage**  
  A beverage that meets the legal criteria for NA status in the jurisdiction of service.

- **NA Draft Pathway**  
  The contiguous set of components used to move NA beverage from **keg → coupler → line → tower → faucet**.

- **Draft Identity Architecture (DIA)**  
  The structured way NA draft identities are applied and linked across physical and digital layers.

- **DraftVerify Tag**  
  A serialized identifier (physical tag and corresponding digital record) assigned to a specific connection point in the NA pathway.

- **DraftVerify Registry**  
  The digital system where all NA tags, venues, products, and verification events are recorded and managed.

- **Verification Event**  
  A logged check where a trained person confirms that a given NA draft pathway remains compliant with this Standard.

- **Identity Lockout**  
  A state in which a keg, line, coupler, or faucet is taken out of NA service until identity and compliance are restored.

Where there is any conflict between terms in this document and other DraftVerify materials, the **F-2 Definitions document prevails**.

## 3. Structure of the DraftVerify System

### 3.1 Two-Layer Model

The DraftVerify Standard is built on two required layers:

1. **Physical Identification Layer**  
   Visual markers and tags that make NA draft obvious and easy to follow.

2. **Digital Traceability Layer**  
   A Registry-backed system that records:

   - which keg is connected where  
   - which product is on which line  
   - when verification events, cleaning, and changes occur  

A draft system is only considered **DraftVerify Compliant** when **both layers are in place and aligned**.

### 3.2 Identity Chain: Keg → Line → Faucet

Each NA draft pathway must be uniquely identifiable across three primary points:

- **Keg Identity** – the keg is marked with a DraftVerify-compliant NA collar and, where applicable, an encoded tag.  
- **Line Identity** – the beer line used for NA is visually distinct and marked according to the Identification Standards.  
- **Faucet Identity** – faucets serving NA products are clearly marked at the point of pour and match the keg/line identity.

### 3.3 Connection Points and Tags

Each NA draft component may receive one or more of the following tag types:

- Keg collar tag  
- Coupler tag  
- Line identification tag(s)  
- Faucet marker tag  

Tag specifications, formats, and placement rules are defined in the **Identification Series (ID-1 through ID-5)** and the **Digital Series (Registry, Tag Activation, and Verification Event specifications)**.

## 4. Core Requirements

To be considered **DraftVerify Compliant**, an NA draft system must meet all of the following high-level requirements.

### 4.1 NA Separation

- NA products must be served on pathways that are flushed, cleaned, and dedicated to the product currently in use.  
- Mixed-use lines (NA and alcoholic) are strongly discouraged. Where unavoidable, strict controls defined in the **System Design** and **Product Switching & Line Reuse Protocol** documents must be followed.  
- Shared towers must implement **Tower Sharing Standards**, including physical and visual separation in tower layouts.

### 4.2 Physical Identification

- All NA kegs must be identified with a DraftVerify-compliant keg collar and required tags.  
- Each NA coupler must have a coupler tag matching the keg and line identity it serves.  
- NA beer lines must be visually marked at consistent intervals and at transitions.  
- Faucets serving NA products must be clearly marked at the handle and/or faucet level.  
- NA identification must remain visible, durable, and readable under typical operating conditions.

### 4.3 Digital Activation and Registry Alignment

- Each NA connection point that receives a DraftVerify tag must be digitally activated in the **DraftVerify Registry** before being used in service.  
- A tag is considered valid only when it exists in the Registry, is associated with the correct venue/system/product, and its status is **Active**.  
- Any change affecting the NA pathway must trigger an update in the Registry according to the **System Modification Protocol**.  
- Verification events must be recorded according to the **Verification Event Specification**.

### 4.4 Verification and Records

- Venues must maintain verification logs, cleaning logs, change logs, and incident logs for NA draft.  
- Records may be digital or physical, but must be accessible, complete, legible, and retained for an appropriate period.  
- Breweries and distributors must maintain upstream records in accordance with their respective implementation and records documents.

## 6. Verification, Compliance, and Use of Mark

### 6.1 Verification Levels

Operators may participate at different levels, defined in more detail in the **Compliance Audit Framework**:

- **Self-Verified** – the venue follows the Standard and maintains records without third-party audits.  
- **Brewery-Verified** – a brewery confirms participating venues meet the Standard for their NA brands.  
- **DraftVerify-Verified** – audits and reviews performed under DraftVerify’s formal process.

### 6.2 Conditions for Using the DraftVerify Mark

An operator may only use the DraftVerify name, marks, or visual identifiers where:

- They are actively following this Standard and the relevant SOPs for their role.  
- They maintain verifiable records that can be produced upon request.  
- Their NA draft systems remain in good standing according to the **Compliance Audit Framework** and **Use of Mark & Certification Policy**.

Misuse of DraftVerify marks is prohibited and may result in loss of mark privileges and other enforcement actions as outlined in the **Certification Policy** and site-wide **Legal Notice**.

## 7. Incident Response and Continuous Improvement

### 7.1 Mis-Serve or Cross-Contact Events

If a mis-serve or cross-contact incident occurs:

- The affected line(s) and components must be immediately locked out from NA use.  
- The incident must be documented according to the **Incident Response & Mis-Serve Procedure**.  
- The Registry must be updated to reflect the incident and any changes.  
- Corrective actions (cleaning, re-tagging, staff re-training) must be implemented before resuming NA service on that pathway.

### 7.2 Field Findings and Feedback

Operators are encouraged to report:

- unclear scenarios  
- edge cases  
- safety concerns  
- recurring failure modes  

These reports inform future revisions as defined in the **Revision & Governance Policy**.
