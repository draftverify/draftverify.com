# DraftVerify Standard v1.0 — Non-Alcoholic Draft Systems  
<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active<br>

</p>

This document constitutes the **primary, authoritative standard** governing the  
identification, separation, and verification of **non-alcoholic (NA) draft systems**  
from keg to faucet.  
It is the foundational document for the complete DraftVerify Standards Library.

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1. Purpose, Scope, and Status

### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this Standard is to define a **uniform, auditable, and globally consistent**  
framework for:

- **Identifying** NA draft beverages  
- **Separating** NA pathways from alcoholic pathways  
- **Verifying** NA draft integrity using physical and digital controls  

The Standard ensures NA draft service is:

- safe  
- repeatable  
- demonstrably compliant  
- trusted by operators and consumers  

### **1.2 Scope**
This Standard applies to all draft-dispensed beverages meeting the legal  
definition of non-alcoholic within the applicable jurisdiction.

It is applicable to:

- breweries producing NA draft products  
- distributors handling NA draft products  
- venues serving NA draft products  
- mixed systems and dedicated NA systems  
- DraftVerify partners and certified operators  

This Standard governs:

- identification systems  
- tagging requirements  
- digital activation  
- verification routines  
- recordkeeping  
- incident response  
- compliance and mark usage  

### **1.3 Status**
DraftVerify Standard v1.0 is a **voluntary, industry-accepted standard**.  
It does **not** replace federal, provincial/state, or municipal regulatory  
requirements. When conflicts occur, **regulatory law overrides**.

The most current version is always available at:  
**https://www.draftverify.com/standards/**

## 2. Normative References & Terminology

### **2.1 Normative References**
This Standard is informed by (but does not replicate) principles from:

- DIN 6650 (dispense system hygiene)  
- ISO 22000 (food safety management)  
- ISO 17065 (certification systems)  
- Brewers Association draft guidelines  
- NSF beverage equipment guidance  

References do **not** imply affiliation or endorsement.

### **2.2 Terminology**
Complete terminology and definitions appear in:

**F-2 — Definitions, Scope & Terminology**  
<https://www.draftverify.com/docs/definitions/>

Where conflicts arise, **F-2 is authoritative**.

Key terms used within this document:

- **NA Beverage** — meets all legal NA criteria  
- **NA Draft Pathway** — keg → coupler → line → tower → faucet  
- **Identity Architecture (DIA)** — structured identity framework  
- **Serialized Tag** — uniquely identified DraftVerify tag  
- **Digital Activation** — linking tag to the DraftVerify Registry  
- **Verification Event** — documented compliance check

## 3. System Architecture

### **3.1 Dual-Layer Compliance Model**
Compliance requires **both**:

1. **Physical Identification Layer**  
2. **Digital Activation Layer**

Physical identity without digital activation is **not compliant**.  
Digital activation without visible identification is **not compliant**.

### **3.2 Continuous Identity Chain**
Each NA draft pathway must maintain a continuous identity through:

- keg  
- coupler  
- line  
- faucet  

Breaks in physical identity or digital records invalidate compliance.

### **3.3 Identification Components**
Identification elements may include:

- keg collar  
- coupler tag  
- line identity tags  
- faucet markers  

Specifications are detailed in **ID-Series Standards (ID-1 through ID-5).**

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4. Core Requirements

### **4.1 NA Separation**
Operators must:

- maintain isolation between NA and alcoholic draft pathways  
- follow the Product Switching & Line Reuse Protocol for any shared components  
- comply with **Tower Sharing Standards** where applicable  

### **4.2 Physical Identification**
All NA components must be:

- visible from the operator’s working distance  
- durable in cold-room and high-humidity environments  
- correctly placed per ID-Series specifications  
- consistent at all points along the NA pathway  

### **4.3 Digital Activation**
All serialized tags must be:

- activated in the DraftVerify Registry  
- assigned to the correct component  
- updated upon system modification  

Tags are valid only when **Active**, **correctly linked**, and **digitally verifiable**.

### **4.4 Verification & Records**
Operators must maintain:

- verification logs  
- cleaning logs  
- change logs  
- incident reports  

Upstream partners (breweries, distributors) must maintain corresponding logs.

If an incident occurs:

- affected components must be immediately locked out  
- incident must be logged in the Registry  
- root cause analysis conducted  
- corrective action implemented
