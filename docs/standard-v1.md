## 1. Purpose, Scope, and Status

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the **DraftVerify Standard v1.0** is to provide a clear, repeatable, and verifiable framework for:

- **Identifying** non-alcoholic (NA) draft products  
- **Separating** NA draft from alcoholic draft  
- **Verifying** the integrity of NA draft service through physical + digital systems  

This Standard makes NA draft service **understandable, explainable, auditable, and trusted**.

### 1.2 Scope
This Standard applies to:

- NA beverages served on draft  
- mixed draft environments  
- dedicated NA draft systems  
- breweries, distributors, and venues participating in DraftVerify  

It covers physical identification, digital activation, verification routines, recordkeeping, and incident response.

### 1.3 Status
DraftVerify Standard v1.0 is a **voluntary industry standard**, not a government regulation.  
Operators remain responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.

The current version is always published at:  
**https://www.draftverify.com/standards/**

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

Full terminology appears in **F-2 — Definitions, Scope & Terminology**.

- **NA Beverage** — meets jurisdictional legal NA definition  
- **NA Draft Pathway** — keg → coupler → line → tower → faucet  
- **Draft Identity Architecture (DIA)** — the structured identity system  
- **DraftVerify Tag** — serialized NA tag with a matching digital record  
- **DraftVerify Registry** — authoritative database of tags, events, and system records  
- **Verification Event** — logged NA compliance check  
- **Identity Lockout** — temporary removal from NA service  

F-2 overrides all other documents when definitions conflict.

## 3. Structure of the DraftVerify System

### 3.1 Two-Layer Model
A system is DraftVerify-compliant only when:

1. **Physical identification** is present  
2. **Digital activation** exists in the Registry  

Both layers must match.

### 3.2 Identity Chain
Each NA pathway has a continuous identity across:

- keg  
- coupler  
- line  
- faucet  

### 3.3 Tagging Requirements
Tags may include:

- keg collar tag  
- coupler tag  
- line identity tags  
- faucet markers  

Specifications are in the **ID Series (ID-1 through ID-5)**.

## 4. Core Requirements

### 4.1 NA Separation
- NA pathways must be isolated from alcoholic lines.  
- Mixed-use lines require strict Product Switching & Line Reuse Protocol.  
- Shared towers must follow **Tower Sharing Standards**.

### 4.2 Physical Identification
All NA components must be:

- visibly marked  
- durable  
- correctly placed  
- consistent with ID standards  

### 4.3 Digital Activation
- All tags must be activated in the DraftVerify Registry.  
- Tags are valid only when Active and correctly linked.  
- Any system modification requires Registry updates.

### 4.4 Verification & Records
Venues must maintain:

- verification logs  
- cleaning logs  
- change logs  
- incident logs  

Breweries and distributors maintain upstream logs.
