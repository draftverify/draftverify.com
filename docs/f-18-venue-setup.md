F-18 defines the **installation rules, physical setup requirements, verification workflows, and operational standards** that venues must follow to ensure safe, accurate, and consistent serving of non-alcoholic (NA) draft beverages.

Venue compliance is the final safeguard in the DraftVerify identity chain. This protocol ensures that NA draft is:

- Installed correctly  
- Clearly identified  
- Verified before service  
- Protected from product mix-ups  
- Documented for audit traceability  

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol establishes the standardized setup and verification steps that ensure:

- Correct keg → coupler → line → faucet mapping  
- Clear NA identification inside the cooler and on the tower  
- Safe and compliant product switching  
- Verification before tapping  
- Accurate service to consumers  

Venues form the last defense against mis-tapping or cross-contamination.

---

## 2. Scope

F-18 applies to:

- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Stadiums  
- Breweries and taprooms  
- Arenas  
- Hotels  
- Any venue serving NA draft  

Covers:

- Setup requirements  
- Line identification  
- Tower identification  
- Verification workflows  
- Product switching  
- Documentation & audits  

---

## 3. Pre-Installation Requirements

Before installation, venues must:

### 3.1 Confirm Dedicated NA Line  
The venue must provide:

- A dedicated line for NA draft, OR  
- A designated line that will be cleaned and re-verified before NA activation  

### 3.2 Cooler Preparation  
Venue must ensure:

- Cooler space exists for NA keg placement  
- NA kegs will not be stored on mixed pallets  
- NA identity will remain visible in stacked storage  

### 3.3 Equipment Inspection  
Installer must confirm:

- Line is intact  
- Coupler is compatible (D-type unless specified)  
- Faucet is functioning and clean  
- Tower space is available for identification marker  

---

## 4. Required Identification Components

Venues must apply the following:

### 4.1 Line Tag (Required)  
Placed 30–45 cm (12–18 inches) above the coupler.

Must display:

- Product name  
- Category color (Gold for NA)  
- Short code (optional)  

### 4.2 Coupler Tag (Required)  
The Coupler Tag must:

- Be zip-tied securely  
- Not rotate freely  
- Be positioned for pre-connection scanning  
- Match the product identity  

### 4.3 Tower Marker (Required for Multi-Tap Bars)  
Placed:

- On the faucet collar, OR  
- Behind the faucet on the tower  

This marker ensures front-of-house clarity.

---

## 5. Venue Setup Steps

### Step 1 — Install NA Line Tag  
Install line tag so it is:

- Visible  
- Upright  
- Secure  

### Step 2 — Attach NA Tower Marker  
Place the tower identifier in the correct orientation.

### Step 3 — Verify Coupler Tag  
Confirm:

- Tag is intact  
- Zip tie is secure  
- Tag identity matches intended product  

### Step 4 — Map Line to Product  
Installer must document:

- Keg identity (DTI)  
- Line number  
- Faucet location  
- Setup date  

Documentation becomes part of the venue’s audit profile.

### Step 5 — Perform Full Verification Scan  
Scan must confirm:

- Product identity  
- NA category  
- Active tag state  
- No mismatches  

---

## 6. Product Switching Protocol

When switching to a new NA keg:

### 6.1 Shut Off Line  
Stop service before switching.

### 6.2 Remove Empty Keg  
Do not cut the Coupler Tag zip tie.

### 6.3 Inspect Coupler Tag  
Installer or staff must check:

- Tag is still intact  
- No tampering occurred  

### 6.4 Scan New Keg Before Connection  
The new keg must be scanned:

- BEFORE attaching the coupler  
- BEFORE chilling or staging  

This ensures the correct keg is being activated for service.

### 6.5 Reconnect and Purge  
Purge line as required by local cleaning standards.

---

## 7. Daily & Weekly Verification Requirements

### 7.1 Daily Requirements  
Front-of-house or bar managers must:

- Verify tower marker is visible  
- Inspect line tag for readability  
- Ensure Coupler Tag zip tie is intact  
- Confirm correct product is being served  

### 7.2 Weekly Requirements  
Managers must:

- Perform verification scan on active keg  
- Review keg placement for NA separation  
- Inspect cooler organization  
- Record verification in F-19 checklist  

---

## 8. Cooler Organization Requirements

NA kegs must:

- Never be stacked under alcoholic kegs  
- Never be placed on mixed pallets  
- Remain visible (tag facing outward)  
- Maintain sidewall band visibility if used  

Venues must uphold NA separation.

---

## 9. Documentation Requirements

Venues must maintain:

- Setup records  
- Verification logs  
- Product switching documentation  
- Weekly checklists  
- Incident reports (if applicable)  

Records must be available for DraftVerify auditors.

---

## 10. Incident Response Requirements

If a venue identifies:

- Incorrect product on tap  
- Tag mismatch  
- Broken or loose zip tie  
- Inactive tag  
- Wrong keg switched in error  

The venue must:

1. **Stop service immediately**  
2. **Disconnect line**  
3. **Document the issue**  
4. **Notify distributor and brewery**  
5. **Log incident under F-22 procedures**  

The keg cannot be served until resolved.

---

## 11. Compliance Requirements

A venue is **F-18 compliant** when:

- NA draft is served only on verified lines  
- Line tags and tower markers are correctly placed  
- Coupler Tags are intact and scanned before connection  
- Daily/weekly checks are completed  
- Documentation is maintained  

Failure to comply may result in:

- Remedial training  
- Corrective action  
- Loss of DraftVerify venue certification  

---

## 12. Summary

F-18 establishes the full venue setup and verification workflow that ensures NA draft is served safely, consistently, and with complete product integrity.

Venues uphold the final step of the identity chain by:

- Installing clear identifiers  
- Scanning before service  
- Maintaining cooler separation  
- Logging verification  
- Responding quickly to incidents  

The result is a trusted, reliable, and standardized NA draft program across all venues.
