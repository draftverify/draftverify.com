# NA Draft System Failure Modes Guide

F-36 defines the **failure modes**, symptoms, root causes, and corrective actions associated with non-alcoholic (NA) draft systems.  
Because NA draft requires strict separation and identity preservation, system failures can cause mis-serve, contamination, or integrity loss.

This guide supports breweries, distributors, and venues in identifying issues early and responding with precision.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This document provides:

- A taxonomy of NA draft failure modes  
- Visual and operational symptoms for detection  
- Root-cause patterns  
- Immediate and long-term corrective actions  
- Preventive maintenance expectations  
- Links to other DraftVerify Standards  

Failure mode awareness is critical to **consumer safety**, **identity protection**, and **regulatory compliance**.

---

## 2. Scope

This guide covers failures involving:

- Kegs  
- Couplers & Coupler Tags  
- Beer lines  
- Taps / faucets  
- Gas systems  
- Cold storage  
- Identity workflow  
- Cleaning & service operations  

Applies to:

- Breweries  
- Distributors  
- Venues  
- Draft technicians  
- Auditors  

---

## 3. Failure Mode Categories

Failure modes are grouped into **six major categories**:

1. **Identity Failures** (highest risk)  
2. **Contamination Failures**  
3. **Mechanical Failures**  
4. **Gas & Pressure Failures**  
5. **Workflow Failures**  
6. **Cleaning & Maintenance Failures**

Each category includes examples, symptoms, root causes, and corrective actions.

## 4. Identity Failure Modes (Critical)

Identity failures directly threaten NA integrity.

### 4.1 Wrong Keg Tapped  
**Symptoms:**  
- Product taste mismatch  
- Verification scan not matching menu  
- Staff confusion during switching  

**Root Causes:**  
- Incorrect keg movement  
- Failure to scan (F-29 requirement)  
- Cooler disorganization  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Stop service; quarantine keg  
- Verification scan of all nearby kegs  
- Review switching workflow  
- Update cooler map (F-19 / F-25)

---

### 4.2 Coupler Tag Missing or Damaged  
**Symptoms:**  
- Tag not found at spear  
- Zip tie cut or loose  
- “Not Active / Unknown” on scan  

**Root Causes:**  
- Mishandling  
- Tag tampering  
- Wrong coupler tag used  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Quarantine keg  
- Notify distributor/brewery  
- Review identity chain logs (F-28 / F-31)

---

### 4.3 Identity Mismatch in Verification Scan  
**Symptoms:**  
- Wrong brewery, product, or DTI  
- Tag shows previous batch  
- Registry inconsistency  

**Root Causes:**  
- Wrong tag activation (F-13 failure)  
- Distributor error (F-15)  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Quarantine keg  
- Audit activation records  
- Correct registry entry (if safe to do so)

---

## 5. Contamination Failure Modes

### 5.1 Alcohol Contamination in NA Line (Critical)  
**Symptoms:**  
- Alcoholic aroma or flavor  
- Customer reports “this tastes like beer”  
- ABV detected in testing  

**Root Causes:**  
- Line previously used for alcoholic beer  
- Incorrect cleaning chemical  
- Shared tower with cross-flow (F-25 issue)  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Immediate shutdown  
- Full system flush  
- Incident Report (F-22 / F-35)  

---

### 5.2 Residual Cleaning Chemical  
**Symptoms:**  
- Chemical smell  
- Harsh taste  
- Tingling sensation  

**Root Causes:**  
- Incomplete rinsing  
- Wrong chemical dilution  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Shut tap  
- Flush line thoroughly  
- Retrain staff  

---

## 6. Mechanical Failure Modes

### 6.1 Faulty Coupler Seal  
**Symptoms:**  
- Leaks at the spear  
- Gas bubbling in line  
- Foamy pour  

**Root Causes:**  
- Worn O-rings  
- Poor connection  
- Bent coupler handle  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Replace seal  
- Test coupler alignment  

---

### 6.2 Keg Pressure Loss  
**Symptoms:**  
- Flat pour  
- Slow pour  
- No flow  

**Root Causes:**  
- Gas leak  
- Empty or warm keg  
- Faulty check valves  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Check gas system (F-26)  
- Inspect keg seals  

---

## 7. Gas & Pressure Failure Modes

### 7.1 Incorrect Gas Mix  
**Symptoms:**  
- Over-carbonation  
- Under-carbonation  
- Foaming  

**Root Causes:**  
- Using CO₂ where mixed gas required  
- Wrong regulator setting  

**Corrective Actions:**  
- Reset regulator  
- Confirm gas type  

---

### 7.2 Regulator Failure  
**Symptoms:**  
- Pressure drift  
- No consistent flow  
- Safety vent activating  

**Root Causes:**

## 10. Failure Mode Reporting Requirements

All critical and major failures must be documented using:

- **F-22** Incident Response Procedure  
- **F-35** Contamination Report  
- **F-31** Audit Log Framework  

Records must be retained for **10 years**.

---

## 11. Summary

The NA Draft System Failure Modes Guide:

- Identifies high-risk failure patterns  
- Enables rapid detection and correction  
- Protects the NA consumer  
- Strengthens the identity chain  
- Reduces mis-serve risk  
- Supports consistent auditability  

Awareness and early detection ensure NA draft integrity across all tiers of the supply chain.
