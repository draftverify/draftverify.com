- opens an identity profile  
- confirms product identity  
- checks activation status  
- logs a verification event  

No brewery-side URL modification is permitted.

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Placement Zone

The Coupler Tag must be applied:

- directly adjacent to the keg spear or coupler flange  
- within 25 mm of the engagement point  
- in a tamper-resistant position  
- visible during keg changeover  

This ensures identity is confirmed **before the coupler is locked**.

---

### 4.2 Adhesion Requirements

Tags must be:

- applied to a clean, dry surface  
- firmly bonded with high-adhesion permanent backing  
- resistant to moisture and cold-chain abrasion  

If a tag becomes loose, damaged, or unreadable, it must be retired and replaced.

---

## 5. Visual Requirements

The Coupler Tag must display:

- DraftVerify NA Gold or NA Blue banding  
- high-weight sans-serif font  
- minimum 8 mm text height  
- uppercase for NA statements  

These visual cues ensure rapid identification by staff.

---

## 6. Programming & Assignment

### 6.1 Centralized Programming (Standard v1.0)

For Version 1.0:

- All tags are pre-programmed by DraftVerify  
- Breweries receive product-specific tag bags  
- No brewery-side programming is required  

This eliminates friction and ensures serialization accuracy.

---

### 6.2 Product Lock-In

Once a tag is assigned:

- it may not be reused  
- it may not be reassigned to another product  
- damaged tags must be retired and replaced  

This prevents identity drift and ensures audit integrity.

---

### 6.3 Optional Future Brewery Programming

Future versions may include:

- a DraftVerify programming app  
- brewery-side bulk programming tools  
- NFC writer hardware  

These features are outside the scope of Standard v1.0.

---

## 7. Verification Workflow

### Step 1 — Visual Check

Staff sees the coupler with a DraftVerify tag before tapping.

### Step 2 — NFC Scan

Before connection:

- staff taps the tag with an NFC-enabled phone  
- the phone opens the verification page automatically  

### Step 3 — Identity Confirmation

The verification page displays:

- brewery  
- product  
- category (NA highlighted in gold)  
- activation status  
- additional metadata  

### Step 4 — Connection

After confirmation, staff connect the coupler.

### Step 5 — Registry Logging

Each scan logs:

- tag ID  
- timestamp  
- high-level venue reference (where enabled)  
- verification outcome  

These logs support traceability and audits.

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

### 8.1 Breweries

- apply tags to all NA kegs  
- ensure tags match correct products  
- report damaged or missing tags  

### 8.2 Distributors

- protect Coupler Tags during handling  
- confirm that tagged kegs remain intact  
- report mismatches, damage, or irregularities  

### 8.3 Venues

- scan tags prior to connection  
- maintain tag visibility and cleanliness  
- report any suspicious or incorrect scan results  

---

## 9. Compliance Requirements

A venue is compliant with F-7 when:

- all NA kegs have DraftVerify Coupler Tags  
- tags are scannable at the point of connection  
- staff verify identity before attaching couplers  
- no tags are damaged, missing, or obstructed  
- mismatched tags are retired and corrected  

Alcoholic products may optionally use tags for brand protection.

---

## 10. Non-Compliance Conditions

Non-compliance includes:

- missing or unscannable tags  
- tag ID not matching Registry  
- altered tags  
- reused tags  
- incorrect placement  
- staff bypassing verification  

Non-compliant kegs must not enter NA service.
