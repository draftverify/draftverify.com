The Distributor Protocol (D-Series) defines how distributors must handle, transport, verify, and document **non-alcoholic (NA)** draft kegs under the DraftVerify Standard.

Distributors are a critical link between breweries and venues.  
Proper handling ensures that identity, activation data, and safety remain intact throughout the supply chain.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Protocol

This protocol ensures that distributors:

- Maintain the DraftVerify identity chain  
- Prevent tampering or accidental tag removal  
- Preserve NA separation during transport  
- Confirm identity during receiving and delivery  
- Enable traceability through verification scans  
- Provide accountability for downstream customers  

Distributors reinforce the brewery-created identity and deliver error-free NA draft to venues.

---

## 2. Scope

This protocol applies to:

- All distributors handling NA draft  
- Warehouse operators  
- Delivery drivers  
- Cross-dock partners  
- Third-party logistics providers (3PL)  

The D-Series includes:

- Receiving procedures  
- Storage & separation  
- Verification workflows  
- Transport rules  
- Delivery procedures  
- Documentation requirements  

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

### 3.1 Distributor Responsibilities  
Distributors must:

- Verify that every NA keg has a DraftVerify Coupler Tag  
- Inspect for tampering or missing tags  
- Scan tags before loading and before delivery  
- Maintain NA separation from alcoholic kegs  
- Document discrepancies immediately  
- Train staff in the D-Series procedures  

### 3.2 Brewery Responsibilities  
Breweries must:

- Supply only activated, tagged NA kegs  
- Provide correct product documentation  
- Notify distributors of any activation or batch corrections  

### 3.3 Venue Responsibilities  
Venues are responsible for:

- Scanning tags before tapping  
- Reporting delivery inconsistencies  

---

## 4. Receiving Kegs From Breweries

When NA kegs are delivered to the distributor:

### 4.1 Visual Inspection  
Staff must check:

- Coupler Tag present  
- Zip tie intact (not cut, loose, or replaced)  
- Tag not rotating freely  
- Collar intact and readable  
- No signs of tampering  

### 4.2 Initial Verification Scan  
Each keg must be scanned using NFC:

- Confirmation page must show correct brewery & product  
- Tag must display **Active** status  
- NA must be clearly highlighted  

### 4.3 Documentation  
Record:

- Receipt date  
- Supplier  
- Product & batch  
- Any discrepancies  
- Driver initials  

If any tag fails scan:  
**TAG MUST BE QUARANTINED** and reported.

---

## 5. Warehouse Storage Requirements

### 5.1 NA Separation  
NA kegs must be stored:

- In a dedicated NA zone **or**  
- Physically separated from alcoholic kegs using pallets/racking  

NA zones must have:

- Clear signage  
- No mixed stacking  
- No mixed palletization  

### 5.2 Stacking  
Kegs must be stacked so:

- Coupler Tags remain visible  
- Tags cannot be crushed or snagged  
- Sidewall bands (if used) remain readable  

### 5.3 Temperature  
Cold storage must not exceed conditions that compromise tag durability.

---

## 6. Pre-Transport Procedures

Before loading:

### 6.1 Verification Scan (Mandatory)  
Each NA keg must be scanned again to confirm:

- Identity  
- Activation status  
- No mismatch or inactive tag  

### 6.2 Load Documentation  
Distributor must log:

- Which kegs are being delivered  
- Delivery route  
- Destination venue  
- Driver identity  

### 6.3 Load Placement Rules  
Arrange kegs to avoid:

- Crushing Coupler Tags  
- Excessive lateral movement  
- Tag obstruction  

---

## 7. Delivery to Venues

### 7.1 Arrival Inspection  
At the venue:

- Driver visually inspects tags  
- Confirms no tampering occurred in transit  

### 7.2 Verification Scan With Venue Staff  
Driver must scan each keg **with the venue** to confirm:

- Correct product  
- Correct NA identity  
- Matching order
