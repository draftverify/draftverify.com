# Visual Lexicon

The Visual Lexicon defines the **official visual language** used in the DraftVerify Standard.  
It establishes the **icons, colors, labels, terminology, and formatting rules** that ensure consistency across kegs, couplers, lines, faucets, documentation, training, and digital interfaces.

This lexicon ensures every participant — breweries, distributors, venues, and auditors — sees the same meaning in the same symbols, regardless of location or experience level.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the DraftVerify Visual Lexicon is to:

- Standardize the appearance of DraftVerify identification points  
- Enhance safety and clarity (especially for NA draft)  
- Prevent confusion caused by inconsistent or improvised labels  
- Create a unified “visual grammar” across all touchpoints  
- Support training and reduce staff errors  
- Build trust and recognizability for the DraftVerify mark  

The lexicon acts as an **identity backbone** for the entire Standards Library.

---

## 2. Scope

This document defines:

- Category color standards  
- Official symbols and icons  
- Line and faucet label formats  
- Tag shorthand codes  
- Safety and compliance markings  
- Naming and formatting rules  

It applies to:

- Keg collars and keg stickers  
- Coupler tags  
- Line tags  
- Faucet markers  
- Printed materials  
- Digital screens and verification pages  
- Training content  

---

## 3. Category Color System

The category color system is the most important visual element in DraftVerify.  
It must be applied consistently across all surfaces.

| Category | Color | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Non-Alcoholic (NA) | Gold | Mandatory for all NA tags, labels, faucets, and screens |
| Alcoholic | Blue | Recommended for alcoholic draft lines and faucets |
| Seasonal / Rotational | Teal | Optional category for rotating taps |
| House / Staff Use | Grey | Optional indicator for internal lines |

Gold is the **non-negotiable** safety color for NA.

## 4. Typography & Naming Conventions

### 4.1 Capitalization
- Product names: Title Case  
- Styles: Sentence case  
- Categories: Uppercase short form allowed (e.g., "NA")  

### 4.2 Label Clarity
Labels must:
- Be short enough for quick scanning  
- Avoid internal jargon or abbreviations unknown to customers  
- Use full product names on faucet markers  

### 4.3 Acceptable Abbreviations
Used primarily on line tags or tight-space identifiers:

- NA = Non-Alcoholic  
- LGR = Lager  
- IPA = India Pale Ale  
- STT = Stout  
- GPS = Guest Tap  

Breweries may define their own abbreviations if they remain unambiguous.

---

## 5. Official Symbols & Icons

### 5.1 NFC Indicator
A simple tap icon is used to signal NFC presence on coupler tags.  
This icon may appear:

- On coupler tags  
- On training pages  
- In the verification UI  

### 5.2 DraftVerify Mark
A minimal DraftVerify identifier may appear on:

- Coupler tags  
- Line tags  
- Faucet markers  
- Documentation  

It serves as a **trust cue**, not a branding element.

### 5.3 Category Badges
Used on digital screens and printed materials:

- Gold circle = NA  
- Blue square = Alcoholic  
- Teal diamond = Seasonal  
- Grey line = House tap  

Badges support fast category recognition.

---

## 6. Label Architecture

### 6.1 Line Tags
Line tags must include:
- Product name or shorthand  
- Category color  
- Optional style  
- Optional short identifier code  

Short codes should be 4–8 characters and purely alphanumeric.

### 6.2 Faucet Markers
Faucet markers must include:
- Full product name  
- Category color  
- Optional style identifier  

Faucet markers should prioritize readability and guest understanding.

### 6.3 Coupler Tag Shorthand Code
Printed codes on coupler tags (not URLs) must:
- Match the registry entry  
- Be alphanumeric only  
- Avoid confusing characters (e.g., O vs 0, 1 vs l)  

The shorthand code is for quick visual reference —  
the NFC tag is the source of truth.

---

## 7. Safety & Compliance Markings

### 7.1 NA Visibility Rules
Non-Alcoholic draft must use:
- Gold category color  
- Clear NA identification in text or icon form  
- No ambiguous labeling  

Staff must be able to identify NA lines **within two seconds**.

### 7.2 Prohibited Visual Patterns
To avoid confusion:
- No red × or warning icons on verified tags  
- No brewery-specific icons that resemble DraftVerify icons  
- No handwritten NA labels on faucet markers  

Handwritten labels are allowed on temporary lines only if:
- They include the gold NA marker  
- They are replaced within 48 hours  

---

## 8. Digital Interface Lexicon

The DraftVerify verification page must display:

- Product name in large text  
- Category color  
- Style  
- Brewery name  
- Status indicator (“Active”)  
- Scan timestamp (optional for venues)  

Colors used in digital UI must match the physical lexicon.

Digital vs physical consistency prevents misinterpretation when staff compare the faucet and coupler identity.

---

## 9. Physical Durability Requirements

All physical lexicon elements must be:

- Moisture-resistant  
- Cooler-safe (down to minus five degrees Celsius)  
- Resistant to abrasion  
- Replaceable without damaging equipment  
- High-contrast and readable in dim cooler lighting  

This ensures the lexicon works in **real service environments**, not theoretical ones.

---

## 10. Rationale

The visual lexicon prevents:
- Mis-taps  
- NA/alcoholic mix-ups  
- Brand confusion  
- Inconsistent venue practices  
- Errors caused by staff turnover  
- Slow training cycles  
- Disputes between breweries, distributors, and venues  

A shared visual language is essential for industry-wide consistency.

---

## 11. Summary

The Visual Lexicon provides a standardized language of symbols, colors, formatting, and identifiers across all DraftVerify components.  
It ensures:

- Instant recognition  
- Safety through color  
- Uniform training  
- Consistent service-side labeling  
- Alignment between keg, coupler, line, faucet, and digital verification  

A shared lexicon brings clarity to the entire draft ecosystem and supports the global adoption of DraftVerify as a unified standard.
