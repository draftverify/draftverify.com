The Visual Lexicon defines the **unified design language** that appears across all DraftVerify physical tags, digital screens, documents, and workflow tools.  
Consistency ensures that staff, auditors, and consumers instantly understand what category a product belongs to, whether it is verified, and what actions are required.

This Standard governs:

- Color usage  
- Shapes and geometry  
- Symbol language  
- Typography requirements  
- Mandatory NA markings  
- Layout hierarchy  

---

## 1. Purpose

The Visual Lexicon:

- ensures national and global consistency  
- creates intuitive recognition for staff in busy environments  
- reduces NA/alcoholic confusion  
- strengthens DraftVerify’s certification identity  
- provides a shared design foundation for all F-series and D-series documents  

This Standard is mandatory for all DraftVerify-certified materials.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to:

- keg collars  
- coupler tags  
- line tags  
- faucet markers  
- distributor labels  
- digital verification screens  
- audit logs  
- training materials  
- venue setup guides  

Anything representing DraftVerify identity must conform to this lexicon.

## 8. Usage Hierarchy

DraftVerify identity appears in this hierarchy:

3. **Symbol Layer** (What must be done?)  
4. **Text Layer** (Specific identity + details)  

This ensures instant understanding for staff and auditors.

## 9. Compliance

A material is **F-10 compliant** if:

- NA materials use NA Gold  
- NA materials use the NA Circle  
- NA wording is correct and uppercase  
- Verification hexagon appears on NFC-enabled items  
- Digital error states follow the red/triangle system  
- Fonts and hierarchy follow DraftVerify specifications
