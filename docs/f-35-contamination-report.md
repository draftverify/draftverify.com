### 5.1 Initial Assessment  
The Venue Compliance Lead reviews:

- Verification logs  
- Staff statements  
- Product switching logs  
- Cooler organization  
- Previous day’s checklist (F-19)

### 5.2 Distributor Assessment  
If distribution or transport may be involved:

- Identity mismatch occurs  
- Tag tampering is possible  
- Mis-serve or near-miss occurred  

Auditor may request:

- Photos / videos  
- Scan logs

## 6. Contamination Categories

### **6.1 Category A — Confirmed Alcoholic Contamination (Critical)**
Examples:
- Alcohol detected in NA draft line  
- Incorrect keg tapped and served  
- NA line cleaned with alcoholic product residue  

Requires immediate shutdown and root-cause investigation.

### **6.2 Category B — Probable Contamination**
Examples:
- Strong flavor mismatch  
- Tag mismatch but correct keg confirmed  
- Line cleaning irregularities  

### **6.3 Category C — Identity or Workflow Error**
Examples:
- Missing verification scan  
- Staff skipped switching protocol  
- Cooler or tower identity confusion  

### **6.4 Category D — False Alarm**
Examples:
- Taste variation within normal range  
- Cleaning residue smell (harmless)  
- Staff misinterpretation  

Documentation is still required.

## 7. Corrective Action Requirements

Every incident requires:

- A written corrective action plan  
- Staff retraining (if applicable)  
- Updated logs and workflow adjustments  
- Follow-up verification scans  
- Confirmation of restored NA identity  

Timelines:

- **Critical Incidents:** 24 hours  
- **Major Incidents:** 72 hours  
- **Minor Issues:** 7 days  

---

## 8. Record Retention

All Safety & Contamination Reports must be retained for **10 years**, including:

- Completed report

- Scan evidence  
- Communication history  
- Corrective action documentation  

These records may be audited during certification renewal (F-32) or compliance audits (F-33).

---

## 9. Summary

F-35 defines the **mandatory reporting and investigation structure** for contamination, safety incidents, mis-serves, and identity concerns in NA draft service.

It ensures:

- Fast response  
- Clear documentation  
- Full traceability  
- Strong consumer protection  
- Root-cause discovery  
- Enforcement of DraftVerify identity standards  

Consistent reporting protects the NA category, reinforces trust, and prevents recurrence of critical incidents.
