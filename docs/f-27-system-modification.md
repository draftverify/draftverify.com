# System Modification Protocol

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

</p>

This protocol governs how draft systems may be **modified, expanded, repurposed, or updated** when serving non-alcoholic (NA) products under the DraftVerify Standard.

Any change to the draft system—even seemingly minor adjustments—can impact NA integrity, verification accuracy, and product safety.  
This protocol ensures modifications are performed safely, documented properly, and never compromise DraftVerify's identity chain.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Protocol

The System Modification Protocol ensures:

- NA products remain isolated and identifiable  
- Changes do not invalidate DraftVerify verification or compliance  
- Lines, faucets, couplers, and towers maintain correct mapping  
- Gas systems remain safe and aligned with brewery requirements  
- Venues and distributors retain full traceability after changes  
- DraftVerify Registry data stays accurate and up-to-date  

---

## 2. Scope

This protocol applies to all modifications of:

- Beverage lines  
- Towers and faucets  
- Couplers and keg connectors  
- Gas systems and regulators  
- Cooler layout or routing  
- Tap handles and ID markers  
- DraftVerify Coupler Tags or Line Tags  
- Installation of new NA lines  
- Repurposing alcoholic lines for NA service  

It applies to:

- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Breweries  
- Stadiums  
- Multi-venue groups  
- Distributors managing on-site installations  

---

## 3. Authorized Personnel

### 3.1 Who May Modify a System
Only:

- Draft technicians  
- Brewery-approved installers  
- Distributor draft specialists  
- DraftVerify-trained technicians  

### 3.2 Who May NOT Modify a System
The following staff may **not** make modifications:

- General bartenders  
- Servers  
- Managers without technical training  
- Venue owners without certification  

Unauthorized modification voids DraftVerify compliance until corrected.

---

## 4. Types of Approved Modifications

Modifications fall into four categories:

### 4.1 Minor Adjustments (Low-Risk)
Allowed with documentation:

- Replacing a worn gasket  
- Tightening clamps  
- Replacing a faucet washer  
- Adjusting CO₂/N₂ pressure **within brewery limits**  

### 4.2 Line Reassignment (Moderate-Risk)
Allowed only after:

- Updating Line ID Tag  
- Updating DraftVerify Registry mapping  
- Performing full verification scan  

Examples:

- Switching a line from Lager → IPA  
- Reassigning a faucet to a different product  

### 4.3 Infrastructure Changes (High-Risk)
Requires technician:

- Installing new lines  
- Changing tower or faucet hardware  
- Rerouting beverage line pathways  
- Installing new regulators  
- Installing additional NA-dedicated lines  

### 4.4 System Expansion (Critical-Risk)
Requires:

- DraftVerify pre-approval  
- Full documentation  
- Compliance inspection  

Examples:

- Adding an entire NA-dedicated tower  
- Converting existing towers to multi-product service  

---

## 5. Modification Workflow

Every modification must follow this workflow:

---

### Step 1 — Pre-Modification Assessment

Technician must record:

- Current faucet → line → coupler → keg mapping  
- Current gas settings  
- Current DraftVerify tag IDs  
- Any existing issues (foaming, contamination, leaks)  

If NA lines are mixed with alcoholic lines → flag for required separation.

---

### Step 2 — Perform Modification Safely

All work must:

- Follow manufacturer specs  
- Avoid damaging coupler tags  
- Avoid removing or covering Line Tags  
- Maintain sanitary conditions  
- Prevent coiling, kinking, or crushing lines  

---

### Step 3 — Update DraftVerify Physical Identifiers

If anything changes, the technician must:

- Replace Line ID Tags if product identity changes  
- Confirm Coupler Tag zip tie integrity  
- Ensure Tower Markers (if used) match new configuration  

Any broken or removed tag requires replacement.

---

### Step 4 — Update DraftVerify Registry Mapping

Technician must update:

- Faucet mapping  
- Line assignment  
- Gas type and pressure settings  
- Product identity per line  

Incorrect digital mapping is considered the same as mis-labeling a keg.

---

### Step 5 — Verification Scan (Mandatory)

Each coupler tag must be scanned to confirm:

- Correct product  
- Correct NA category  
- Correct line assignment  
- No registry mismatches  

A system cannot resume service until mapping is validated.

---

### Step 6 — Post-Modification Testing

Perform:

- Flow test  
- Foaming check  
- Leak check  
- Gas pressure validation  
- Taste-and-clarity check (if brewery allows)  

---

### Step 7 — Documentation & Sign-off

Technician must finalize:

- Modification report  
- Updated system map  
- Updated registry entries  
- Photos of line tags, couplers, and tower  

Venue manager must sign off that:

- System is operational  
- Identity mapping is correct  
- Staff understand changes  

---

## 6. Prohibited Modifications

The following actions are strictly prohibited:

- Removing or relocating DraftVerify Coupler Tags  
- Cutting and reusing Coupler Tag zip ties  
- Repurposing NA lines for alcoholic products without full verification  
- Mixing NA and alcoholic products on the same gas line when not approved  
- Using non-brewery-approved gas blends  
- Changing pressure settings beyond manufacturer limits  
- Installing unlabelled lines or faucets  

Violations result in immediate loss of DraftVerify compliance.

---

## 7. Reporting Requirements

After modification, technician must record:

- Date of modification  
- Technician name & certification  
- Description of change  
- Product identities affected  
- Updated mapping  
- Verification scan results  
- Any issues discovered  

Reports must be kept for **12 months** and provided during audits.

---

## 8. Compliance Requirements

A venue is compliant only if:

- All modifications are documented  
- Registry mapping is accurate  
- All tags remain intact and readable  
- Verification scans are performed  
- Only authorized personnel make changes  

If any modification fails compliance:

- System must not serve NA draft  
- Corrective action must be taken  
- DraftVerify may require inspection  

---

## 9. Summary

The System Modification Protocol ensures:

- NA identity remains correct after any system change  
- Draft lines are always properly mapped  
- Verification remains reliable  
- Staff and technicians avoid accidental mis-serve  
- Venues maintain safe, accurate, and compliant NA draft service  

Modification without documentation is one of the leading causes of NA mis-serve.  
This protocol eliminates that risk through clear rules and mandatory verification.
