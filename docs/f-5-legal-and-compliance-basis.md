This document defines the **legal, regulatory, and compliance foundation** supporting the requirement for dedicated identification and verification of non-alcoholic (NA) draft systems.  

While DraftVerify is **not a regulatory body**, the Standard is grounded in real legal obligations, alcohol-service requirements, consumer-protection laws, and venue-level liability frameworks.

<!-- SECTION 1 — PURPOSE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- outline the **legal risks** associated with mis-serving alcoholic beverages as NA  
- define the **compliance justification** for NA-specific identification  
- describe the **liability exposure** for breweries, distributors, and venues  
- ensure operators understand why DraftVerify provides **due diligence** and **audit protection**  

DraftVerify is a voluntary standard, but the risks it mitigates are **legally binding**.

<!-- SECTION 2 — LEGAL FOUNDATIONS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 2.0 Legal Foundations for NA Draft Separation

Regulatory systems worldwide treat alcoholic beverages as a controlled product.  
Serving alcohol when a consumer expects NA can violate:

- alcohol licensing laws  
- age-restriction laws  
- impairment and driving laws  
- truth-in-service and consumer protection laws  
- health disclosures  
- workplace safety statutes  
- insurance policy conditions  

Failure to identify NA draft correctly introduces **legal harm that does not exist** in alcoholic-to-alcoholic mis-serves.

<!-- SECTION 3 — LIABILITY & RISK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3.0 Liability Exposure

### 3.1 Licensing Liability  
A venue is legally responsible for ensuring that alcoholic beverages are served only when intended.

A mis-serve to:
- minors  
- drivers  
- pregnant individuals  
- medically restricted guests  
- people in recovery  

…creates significant legal risk.

### 3.2 Duty of Care  
Hospitality operators owe a **duty of care** to protect consumers from foreseeable harm.  
Accidental alcohol service to an NA consumer is considered **foreseeable** when systems lack proper identification.

### 3.3 Negligence  
A venue may be considered negligent if:
- identification was unclear  
- staff were not provided with proper systems  
- industry-standard precautions (such as DraftVerify) were not used  

### 3.4 Insurance Exposure  
Most insurance policies exclude coverage when:
- alcohol is served contrary to licensing rules  
- staff fail to follow established safety protocols  
- consumer safety expectations are violated  

DraftVerify provides documented due diligence that insurers recognize.

<!-- SECTION 4 — CONSUMER PROTECTION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Consumer-Protection Requirements

NA consumers rely on clarity and correctness of service.

Legal frameworks require venues to:
- accurately disclose what is being served  
- prevent misrepresentation  
- ensure consumers can make informed decisions  

Because draft systems do not display package labels, NA draft requires a **visual and digital replacement** for that disclosure.

DraftVerify provides that mechanism.

<!-- SECTION 5 — BRAND & MANUFACTURER OBLIGATIONS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5.0 Brewery and Manufacturer Compliance Obligations

Brewery-produced NA products must be represented accurately downstream.  
Failure to prevent NA→alcohol mis-serves may:

- violate brand integrity  
- create false product representation  
- undermine claims related to health or sobriety  
- expose breweries to civil liability  

The DraftVerify Standard allows breweries to demonstrate **reasonable safety measures** and **identity protection**.

<!-- SECTION 6 — BASIS FOR IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Why Physical Identification Is Legally Necessary

Draft beer lacks the physical label present on packaged NA beverages.  
Therefore, identity must be maintained through:

### 6.1 Keg Identification  
Proves the correct product is connected.

### 6.2 Coupler Tagging  
Ensures NA identity is preserved at the attachment point.

### 6.3 Beer Line Identification  
Prevents cross-connection and accidental switching.

### 6.4 Faucet Identification  
Provides consumers with the visual disclosure required by consumer protection laws.

DraftVerify harmonizes all four points of legal disclosure into a single system.

<!-- SECTION 7 — BASIS FOR DIGITAL VERIFICATION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7.0 Why Digital Verification Is Legally Necessary

Physical identification alone cannot meet modern compliance expectations.

Digital activation provides:
- chain-of-custody records  
- time-stamped verification logs  
- batch and product traceability  
- auditable compliance documentation  
- evidence of due diligence  

In a mis-serve or legal claim, the DraftVerify Registry becomes the **single source of truth** demonstrating operational responsibility.

<!-- SECTION 8 — COMPLIANCE BENEFITS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 8.0 Compliance Benefits for Operators

DraftVerify provides operators with:

- a legally defensible framework  
- recordkeeping that shows due diligence  
- reduced liability exposure  
- verifiable staff compliance routines  
- audit-ready logs  
- enhanced insurance defensibility  

DraftVerify does *not* replace licensing or regulatory obligations, but it strengthens compliance frameworks.

<!-- SECTION 9 — LIMITATIONS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 9.0 Limitations

DraftVerify is:

- not a government agency  
- not a regulatory enforcement system  
- not a substitute for local liquor, food safety, or health laws  

Where law conflicts with the DraftVerify Standard, **law supersedes the Standard**.
