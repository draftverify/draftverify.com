This document defines the **legal rationale** behind the DraftVerify Standard v1.0 and outlines why non-alcoholic draft systems require **strict identification, separation, and verification** in any venue serving both alcoholic and NA beverages on draft.

<!-- SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1.0 Introduction

Serving alcoholic beverages under the representation of “non-alcoholic” introduces a rare combination of:

- **alcohol service liability**  
- **consumer rights law**  
- **health/privacy considerations**  
- **insurance exposure**  
- **operational negligence risk**  

The following compliance framework explains the **legal necessity** of a formal NA draft standard.

DraftVerify is built to satisfy three core obligations:

1. **Duty of care**  
2. **Truth-in-service requirements**  
3. **Risk mitigation and documentation**

<!-- SECTION 2 — DUTY OF CARE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 2.0 Duty of Care Obligations

Venues and operators have a legal obligation to prevent foreseeable harm.

### 2.1 Foreseeable Harm Is High for NA Consumers
NA consumers may be:
- sober by medical requirement  
- driving  
- pregnant  
- managing addiction recovery  
- avoiding alcohol for religious or personal reasons  

A mis-serve is not simply a customer inconvenience — it may constitute **actual harm**, triggering liability.

### 2.2 Reasonable Preventative Measures Are Required
The legal test is:
> *“Did the venue implement reasonable operational safeguards to prevent foreseeable harm?”*

Historically, no system existed for NA draft.  
DraftVerify creates the **industry-standard safeguard**.

### 2.3 Identification + Verification = Reasonable Safeguard
Physical tags + digital activation + logs demonstrate:

- intent to prevent mis-serve  
- staff clarity  
- ongoing supervision  
- traceability  

This matters in litigation, insurance claims, and regulatory review.

<!-- SECTION 3 — TRUTH-IN-SERVICE REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3.0 Truth-in-Service Requirements

### 3.1 Misrepresentation of Product Identity
Serving alcohol as “non-alcoholic” violates:

- consumer protection law  
- labeling law  
- food & beverage identity regulations  
- federal/provincial alcohol service law  

Draft systems remove packaging labels — creating conditions for misrepresentation unless clear identification exists.

### 3.2 Product Identity Must Be Verifiable
Consumers must have the ability to confirm:
- product category  
- alcohol content  
- accurate identity  

Physical DraftVerify tags + registry entries provide this.

### 3.3 Venue Compliance Documentation
DraftVerify provides:
- verification logs  
- cleaning records  
- change logs  
- photographic evidence  
- tag activation time stamps  

This documentation becomes crucial for audits and defense.

<!-- SECTION 4 — LIABILITY & INSURANCE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Liability & Insurance Considerations

### 4.1 Alcohol Service Liability
If a consumer is mis-served alcohol while expecting NA, the venue may face claims for:

- negligence  
- breach of duty  
- failure to prevent foreseeable harm  
- breach of consumer protection obligations  

### 4.2 Insurance Position
Insurance carriers may deny a claim if:
- the venue had no identification system  
- no verification logs existed  
- staff training was inadequate  
- there was no documented NA separation protocol  

DraftVerify provides a **repeatable, auditable risk-management system**.

### 4.3 Brewery Liability Exposure
Brewery NA brands are at risk if:
- their beer is served incorrectly, or  
- a mis-serve occurs under their branding  

DraftVerify creates provable protection for breweries.

<!-- SECTION 5 — REGULATORY BASIS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5.0 Regulatory Basis for NA Line Separation

### 5.1 Alcohol Regulations
Even though NA beer contains little or no alcohol, it is **not** legally interchangeable with alcoholic beverages.

Mixing lines or ambiguous labeling:
- violates category identity  
- creates risk of unlawful service  
- can breach local liquor regulations  

### 5.2 Health & Food Safety Regulations
DraftVerify supports:
- allergen disclosure  
- accurate product identity  
- integrity of food handling systems  
- sanitary line management

### 5.3 Emerging Regulatory Scrutiny
The rapid rise of NA draft increases regulatory visibility.  
A standardized system helps avoid future regulatory burden.

<!-- SECTION 6 — WHY DIGITAL VERIFICATION IS REQUIRED -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Why Digital Verification Is a Required Component

Physical labeling alone does not satisfy legal expectations.

Digital verification provides:
- proof of which keg was tapped where  
- evidence of compliance  
- logs of ongoing checks  
- chain-of-custody visibility  
- audit-ready documentation  

A physical tag without a digital record is not compliant with DraftVerify Standard v1.0.

<!-- SECTION 7 — ENFORCEABILITY -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7.0 Enforceability of the DraftVerify Standard

DraftVerify is a **voluntary industry standard**, but it becomes enforceable when:

- adopted by breweries  
- included in distribution agreements  
- referenced in insurance policies  
- integrated into venue SOPs  
- used as evidence of reasonable care  

This establishes DraftVerify as the **de facto compliance framework**.
