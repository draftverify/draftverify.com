Version: 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

This guide provides breweries with the complete operational workflow required to adopt and maintain the DraftVerify Standard for non-alcoholic (NA) draft service.

It outlines:

- materials supplied by DraftVerify  
- tagging and identification steps  
- production floor workflows  
- record-keeping requirements  
- distributor and venue expectations  
- compliance and verification rules  

This guide is intended for brewery production teams, packaging managers, QA personnel, and compliance officers.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Brewery Implementation Guide ensures:

- NA kegs are properly tagged  
- product identity is preserved from packaging → tap  
- all physical and digital DraftVerify rules are followed  
- distributors and venues receive consistent materials  
- NA draft risk is mitigated at the point of origin  

Breweries serve as the **first link** in the DraftVerify identity chain.

---

## 2. Scope

This guide applies to:

- any brewery producing NA draft  
- contract brewers producing NA SKUs  
- breweries distributing NA kegs to external venues  
- breweries operating taprooms or satellite locations  

It defines workflows for:

- keg collar use  
- coupler tagging  
- line tag preparation  
- registry activation (if provider-enabled)  
- quality and compliance checks  

---

## 3. Materials Provided by DraftVerify

DraftVerify provides:

### 3.1 NA Keg Collars
Pre-printed collars including:

- NA Gold category band  
- brewery + product name  
- mandatory NA text  
- DraftVerify-compliant layout  

### 3.2 Coupler Tags (NFC Enabled)
Each tag includes:

- product-specific programming (v1.0)  
- cryptographically unique ID  
- NA banding  
- permanent adhesive or ring mount  

### 3.3 Alternate Placement Aids
(Optional, based on brewery order)

- NA sidewall bands  
- secondary stickers  
- cold-room shelf dividers  

### 3.4 Documentation Package
Including:

- F-6 Keg Identification Standard  
- F-7 Coupler Tag Standard  
- F-8 Line Identification Standard  
- F-12 Programming SOP (when applicable)  
- F-13 Activation Workflow  

---

## 4. Brewery Workflow Overview

The full brewery workflow consists of:

1. **Receiving materials**  
2. **Staging kegs for packaging**  
3. **Applying NA keg collars**  
4. **Applying coupler tags**  
5. **Optional sidewall ID**  
6. **Recording tag usage (automated or manual)**  
7. **Preparing distributor-ready line tags**  
8. **Final QA check**  

Each step must be followed to ensure DraftVerify compliance.

---

## 5. Packaging Line Procedures

### 5.1 Pre-Run Setup

Before beginning an NA packaging run:

- verify the correct collars are present  
- verify the correct coupler tags are on hand  
- confirm all previous alcoholic products have been cleared  
- sanitize filler heads, keg washers, and couplers  

### 5.2 Applying Keg Collars

Keg collars must be:

- fully seated  
- free of tears or folds  
- placed after filling but before palletizing  
- visible in both upright and stacked orientations  

Collars must include the required NA text:

**NON-ALCOHOLIC DRAFT**  
or  
**0.0% DRAFT (NON-ALCOHOLIC)**

### 5.3 Applying Coupler Tags

The coupler tag must be:

- applied beside the spear flange  
- within 25 mm of the coupler engagement point  
- unobstructed  
- applied *before* kegs leave the packaging floor  

Each tag’s identity is already preprogrammed.

---

## 6. Registry Activation (Optional)

Depending on the brewery program version:

### 6.1 Full-Service Activation (v1.0 Default)
DraftVerify activates all tags centrally.

Breweries only apply:

- keg collar  
- coupler tag  

### 6.2 Hybrid Self-Activation (Future)
Breweries may scan and activate during packaging, sending batch data:

- batch ID  
- fill date  
- volume  
- product assignment  

### 6.3 Full Brewery-Side Programming (Not in v1.0)
Future versions include:

- mobile programming app  
- desktop encoder  
- automated mapping workflows  

---

## 7. Line Tag Preparation for Distributors

Breweries must prepare line tags for the distributor or venue.  
Each line tag must:

- match the product name and style  
- use the correct DraftVerify color system  
- include the alphanumeric identity code  
- be placed inside the keg shipment or attached externally  

Line tags must be included with **every keg**, even if the distributor is NA-only.

---

## 8. Quality Assurance Requirements

Breweries must check:

- collars are intact  
- coupler tags are correctly applied  
- NA wording is visible  
- product identity matches SKU  
- packaging lines were flushed/washed correctly  
- tag IDs match the intended product  

Any keg failing QA must be:

1. removed from service  
2. corrected  
3. re-checked  

---

## 9. Distributor Expectations

Breweries must ensure:

- distributors understand line tag usage  
- coupler tags must not be removed  
- kegs remain properly labeled  
- NA products are not mixed with alcoholic deliveries (where applicable)  

DraftVerify provides distributor-specific training in the D-Series documents.

---

## 10. Venue Expectations

Breweries must ensure that venues:

- receive correct faucet and line tags  
- understand NA identification rules  
- know how to scan Coupler Tags  
- follow the verification workflow  

Breweries may provide the F-18 Venue Setup Guide to support this.

---

## 11. Compliance Requirements

A brewery is **F-11 compliant** when:

- all NA kegs have collars + coupler tags  
- line tags accompany every keg  
- registry rules (if applicable) are followed  
- QA steps are documented  
- distributors receive correct identification materials  

---

## 12. Summary

The Brewery Implementation Guide ensures DraftVerify begins with a consistent, accurate, and standardized workflow at the point of origin — the brewery.

By following this guide, breweries enable:

- safer NA draft service  
- stronger brand protection  
- reduced risk for venues  
- smoother distributor operations  
- complete traceability  

DraftVerify begins where the product is created — and identity is preserved through every step of the draft system.
