# Incident Response & Mis-Serve Procedure

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active  
<br>© 2025 DraftVerify™ Standards Initiative. All rights reserved.
</p>

This document defines the **mandatory response protocol** for all incidents involving:

- Mis-serve of alcoholic beer to an NA customer  
- Cross-contamination of NA draft  
- Incorrect keg connection  
- Failed identity checks  
- Damaged or missing DraftVerify tags  
- Any event posing safety, regulatory, or reputational risk  

DraftVerify does **not** assign blame — it provides a standardized, defensible, and auditable process for responding to incidents.

---

## 1. Purpose

The goal of this protocol is to:

- Protect NA consumers from harm  
- Ensure proper and immediate incident containment  
- Provide venues with a clear step-by-step response  
- Create a defensible audit trail  
- Support breweries and distributors in root-cause analysis  
- Strengthen the identity chain and prevent repeat events  

Incidents must never be ignored or handled informally.

---

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to:

- Venues (bars, restaurants, stadiums, taprooms)  
- Brewery representatives  
- Distributor personnel  
- Draft technicians  
- Multi-venue operators  

Covers:

- Mis-serve events  
- Identity mismatches  
- Tag failures or tampering  
- Product contamination  
- Line mix-ups  
- Incorrect keg installations  

---

## 3. Incident Categories

### **3.1 Mis-Serve to NA Consumer (Critical)**
Serving alcoholic beer when an NA product was requested.

### **3.2 Identity Failure**
NFC scan mismatch, inactive tag, wrong product display, or missing tag.

### **3.3 Cross-Contamination**
Alcohol or cleaning chemicals entering an NA line.

### **3.4 Wrong Keg Connected**
Correct tag but incorrect physical keg installed.

### **3.5 Tag Tampering / Damage**
Cut zip tie, removed tag, unreadable data, or forced replacement.

### **3.6 Customer-Reported Issue**
Taste anomalies, suspicion of wrong product, or illness.

---

## 4. Immediate Response Protocol (All Incidents)

Every incident must follow these **seven steps**:

### **Step 1 — Stop Service Immediately**
- Cease pouring from the affected tap.  
- Prevent additional customers from being served.

### **Step 2 — Secure the Keg & Line**
- Disconnect the coupler.  
- Mark the keg as **QUARANTINED**.  
- Do not reconnect until investigation is complete.

### **Step 3 — Preserve Evidence**
Do NOT clean:

- Faucet  
- Coupler  
- Line  
- Keg exterior  

Evidence must remain intact for troubleshooting.

### **Step 4 — Document the Situation**
Record:

- Time & date  
- Product name  
- Line number  
- Staff involved  
- What prompted the incident  
- Customer statements (if any)

### **Step 5 — Verify Identity**
Perform:

- NFC scan  
- Visual collar check  
- Line tag verification  
- Compare against venue product map (F-18)

### **Step 6 — Notify Responsible Parties**
Contact:

- Venue manager  
- Distributor  
- Brewery  
- DraftVerify (if required)

### **Step 7 — Replace With Verified Product**
Install a fully verified keg following **F-18 Venue Setup Protocol**.

## 5. Mis-Serve Procedure (Critical Events)

When alcoholic beer has been served as NA:

### **5.1 Engage With the Customer**
- Apologize immediately.  
- Inform them of the error truthfully.  
- Offer assistance (non-medical).  
- Never downplay the situation.

### **5.2 Notify Management**
Customer must not leave before documentation is complete.

### **5.3 Determine Exposure**
Assess:

- Volume consumed  
- Number of affected customers  
- Whether minors or medically restricted individuals were impacted

### **5.4 Regulatory Considerations**
Local liquor authority requirements may mandate:

- Mandatory reporting  
- Investigation  
- Staff retraining  

### **5.5 Audit Log Entry**
Complete a full incident report in accordance with **F-31**.

---

## 6. Identity Failure Protocol

Triggers:

- NFC tag shows wrong product  
- Tag inactive  
- Tag unregistered  
- Tag missing  
- Mismatched DTI  

### **Required Actions**
- Quarantine keg  
- Replace coupler tag only with brewery or distributor authorization  
- Notify brewery for registry correction  
- Document the tag failure event  

Identity failures must NEVER be bypassed.

---

## 7. Cross-Contamination Protocol

Cross-contamination requires:

- Full line flush  
- Chemical cleaning  
- Verification scan  
- Supervisor approval before returning to service  

Mandatory logs:

- Cleaning Log (F-21)  
- Incident Log (This document)  
- Line Reassignment Log (if applicable)

---

## 8. Wrong Keg Connection Protocol

Occurs when:

- Correct line tag  
- Wrong keg physically tapped  

### Required Actions:
- Disconnect immediately  
- Verify coupler tag  
- Update line map  
- Retrain staff as needed  
- Complete incident documentation  

---

## 9. Tag Tampering or Damage

Indicators:

- Cut or loose zip tie  
- Tag removed or substituted  
- Tag rotated or forced  
- Zip-tie remnants on coupler  

### Required Actions:
- Quarantine keg  
- Report immediately to brewery  
- Do not reconnect  
- Replace tag ONLY with serialized replacement authorized in F-12  

Tampering is assumed unless proven otherwise.

---

## 10. Documentation Requirements

Every incident requires:

### **10.1 Incident Report**
Including:

- Date & time  
- Staff involved  
- Identity checks performed  
- Verification results  
- Customer involvement  
- Root cause analysis  
- Corrective actions  

### **10.2 Supporting Logs**
- Cleaning Log (F-21)  
- Activation / Tag Log (F-12, F-13)  
- Delivery Logs (F-17)  
- Venue Setup & Line Map (F-18)  
- Product Switching Log (F-39)

### **10.3 Signatures**
Required:

- Staff member  
- Supervisor  
- Venue manager  

Multi-venue operators must also have regional manager approval.

---

## 11. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

RCA must answer:

- What caused the incident?  
- Why did identity checks fail?  
- Where in the chain the breakdown occurred?  
- How will recurrence be prevented?  

This RCA becomes part of the DraftVerify audit history.

---

## 12. Preventive Actions

Following an incident, venues must implement:

- Staff retraining  
- Updated line maps  
- Modified kegroom organization  
- Enforcement of NA separation rules  
- Enhanced verification routines  

---

## 13. Compliance Requirements

A venue is DraftVerify-compliant when:

- All incidents are documented  
- Mis-serves are treated as critical  
- No keg is put back into service without investigation  
- Identity failures trigger quarantine  
- Records align with F-31 Audit Framework  

Failure to follow this SOP may lead to:

- Loss of DraftVerify certification  
- Brewery or distributor intervention  
- Reporting to authorities (in critical events)

---

## 14. Summary

The Incident Response & Mis-Serve Procedure ensures:

- Safety of NA consumers  
- Protection against legal exposure  
- Preservation of the DraftVerify identity chain  
- Accurate investigation & documentation  
- Rapid correction and prevention  

Every incident — major or minor — must be handled with structure, transparency, and urgency.
