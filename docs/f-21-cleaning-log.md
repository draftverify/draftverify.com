# Cleaning Log SOP

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active  
<br>© 2025 DraftVerify™ Standards Initiative. All rights reserved.
</p>

The Cleaning Log SOP defines mandatory documentation procedures for cleaning, sanitizing, and maintaining draft beverage systems serving **non-alcoholic (NA)** and alcoholic products under the DraftVerify Standard.

While DraftVerify does not define *how* to clean lines (regional regulations apply), it defines *how cleaning must be recorded* to ensure identity integrity, NA separation, and audit readiness.

---

## 1. Purpose

This SOP ensures:

- Accurate documentation of all cleaning cycles  
- Traceability for health and regulatory audits  
- Clear separation of NA and alcoholic cleaning routines  
- Prevention of cross-contamination  
- Verification of technician work  
- Consistency across all venues  

Cleaning logs are part of the identity chain because improper cleaning can compromise NA integrity or lead to contamination events described in **F-35**.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Breweries with taprooms  
- Stadiums & multi-venue operations  
- Draft service technicians  
- Maintenance contractors  

Covers:

- Line cleaning  
- Faucet disassembly and sanitation  
- Coupler cleaning  
- Keg room sanitation  
- Tower maintenance  
- Gas line and regulator hygiene checks  

Does **not** cover:

- Identity modifications (F-20)  
- Incident responses (F-22)  

---

## 3. Cleaning Schedule Requirements

Each venue must follow:

### 3.1 Regional Cleaning Regulations  
If local health authorities mandate a frequency (e.g., every 2 weeks), that requirement supersedes.

### 3.2 Recommended Minimum  
If no regulations exist:

- **Every 14 days** — Full line cleaning  
- **Every keg change** — Coupler sanitation  
- **Every 30 days** — Tower and faucet deep clean  
- **Every 90 days** — Gas system hygiene check  

### 3.3 NA Priority  
Lines dedicated to NA draft must receive:

- Equal or higher cleaning frequency  
- Documented confirmation of NA-only line status  

---

## 4. Required Cleaning Log Fields

Each entry must include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date & Time** | When cleaning occurred |
| **Venue Name** | Location of the system |
| **Technician Name** | Staff or contractor |
| **Lines Cleaned** | Identify by number and product |
| **NA Lines?** | Yes/No indicator |
| **Cleaning Method** | Chemical, recirculation, pressure, etc. |
| **Faucets & Couplers Cleaned?** | Yes/No |
| **Sanitizer Used** | Product & concentration |
| **Before/After Observations** | Foam issues, buildup, obstructions |
| **Verification Performed?** | Identity scan or visual confirmation |
| **Technician Signature** | Required |
| **Manager Approval** | Required |

Logs may be digital or paper but must be legible and retrievable.

## 5. Cleaning Workflow

### Step 1 — Preparation
- Identify NA vs alcoholic lines  
- Confirm products currently on each line  
- Gather safety equipment and chemicals  
- Ensure DraftVerify Coupler Tags are not removed  

### Step 2 — Cleaning Execution
Technician completes:

- Chemical recirculation  
- Faucet disassembly and soak  
- Coupler cleaning  
- Tower exterior sanitation  
- Gas line hygiene inspection  

### Step 3 — Verification
Technician confirms:

- All lines cleaned match the log  
- NA lines remain NA-only  
- No coupler tag interference  
- No identity labels damaged  

### Step 4 — Recording
Fill out the Cleaning Log immediately with all required fields.

### Step 5 — Approval
Supervisor or manager signs the log.

## 6. NA-Specific Cleaning Rules

### 6.1 NA-Only Lines
Lines dedicated to NA beverages must:

- Be marked with NA Gold in accordance with **F-8**  
- Never be temporarily used for alcoholic products  
- Undergo cleaning with NA-safe chemicals only  

### 6.2 Mixed Towers
If NA and alcoholic products share a tower:

- NA faucet must be cleaned first  
- Tools must be sanitized between products  
- Technician must verify all identity labels remain intact  

### 6.3 Product Switching
If a line switches products:

- A cleaning log must be completed  
- A change log entry must be created (see F-20)  

---

## 7. Record Storage & Retention

Venues must retain cleaning logs for **minimum 12 months**, stored:

- Digitally (preferred)  
- In a dedicated binder  
- In any audit-ready format  

Multi-venue operations (F-34) must store records for **24–36 months**.

Logs must be:

- Readable  
- Complete  
- Chronologically ordered  
- Tamper-resistant  

---

## 8. Compliance Requirements

A venue is DraftVerify-compliant when:

- Cleaning logs are complete and up to date  
- NA lines are clearly separated and documented  
- Technicians follow the workflow  
- Logs match the venue’s product switching history  
- No missing signatures  
- No undocumented gaps in cleaning cycles  

Non-compliance may result in:

- Corrective actions  
- Audit failure  
- Loss of DraftVerify certification  

---

## 9. Common Cleaning Log Errors

- Missing technician signatures  
- NA lines not clearly identified  
- Cleaning performed but not logged  
- Logs stored in multiple locations  
- Illegible handwriting  
- Incorrect dates or skipped periods  

These errors weaken audit trail integrity.

---

## 10. Summary

The Cleaning Log SOP ensures:

- Transparent sanitation practices  
- Strong audit trail  
- Protection against contamination  
- NA integrity and consumer safety  
- Alignment between cleaning cycles and DraftVerify identity standards  

A clean system is a safe system — and a safe system depends on proper documentation.
