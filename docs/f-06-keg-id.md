# Keg Identification Standard

This Standard defines the **mandatory physical identification requirements** for all non-alcoholic (NA) draft kegs served under DraftVerify Standard v1.0.

The keg is the **origin point** of the identity chain.  
Accurate, durable, unambiguous identification ensures that NA products remain correctly labeled through brewing, distribution, and venue service.

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard ensures that:

- NA kegs are clearly distinguishable from alcoholic kegs  
- staff can visually confirm correct identity during changeovers  
- distributors maintain chain-of-custody accuracy  
- venues can trace NA products back to source  
- DraftVerify Registry identities align with physical identifiers  

Keg identification is **mandatory** for DraftVerify compliance.

---

## 2. Required Identification Components

Every NA keg must display the following **three** DraftVerify identifiers:

### 2.1 Keg Collar (Primary Identifier)

A DraftVerify-approved NA collar that includes:

- the DraftVerify NA color band (Gold or NA Blue)  
- brewery name  
- product name  
- serialized DraftVerify Tag ID  
- required NA statement (“NON-ALCOHOLIC DRAFT”)  

The collar is the **primary visual identifier** of NA status.

---

### 2.2 Serialized Coupler Tag (Mandatory)

Affixed to the keg spear or coupler flange.

Coupler tags must include:

- DraftVerify NA band  
- NFC-enabled UID or serialized tag ID  
- permanent mapping to the DraftVerify Registry  

(Encoding rules defined in **F-12 — Brewery NFC Tag Serialization SOP**.)

The coupler tag is the **digital identity point**.

---

### 2.3 Optional Sidewall Identification

Used to improve visibility in:

- stacked coolers  
- high-density storage  
- dark or low-visibility environments  

Optional elements include:

- NA sidewall band  
- printed NA stripe  
- secondary QA label  

These enhance operational clarity but are not required for compliance.

---

## 3. Visual Requirements

### 3.1 Color System (Mandatory)

All NA keg identifiers must use either:

- **DraftVerify NA Gold Band**, or  
- **DraftVerify NA Blue Band** (alternate program version)

Colors must meet:

- high visibility  
- matte, non-reflective finish  
- minimum 25 mm (1 inch) band height  

This ensures unmistakable NA identification.

---

### 3.2 Typography

All NA keg identifiers must use:

- bold sans-serif font  
- minimum 9 mm text height  
- uppercase for required NA statements  

Typography must remain readable under condensation and low light.

---

### 3.3 Required NA Statements

Approved NA text:

**NON-ALCOHOLIC DRAFT**  
or  
**0.0% DRAFT (NON-ALCOHOLIC)**  

No other variations are permitted.

---

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Keg Collar Placement

The keg collar must be:

- fully seated and unobstructed  
- visible in both upright and stacked positions  
- intact throughout the keg lifecycle  

Torn or obscured collars violate F-6 compliance.

---

### 4.2 Coupler Tag Placement

The coupler tag must be attached:

- directly adjacent to the spear or coupler flange  
- in a tamper-resistant position  
- within 25 mm of the engagement point  

This ensures staff verify identity **during changeover**.

---

### 4.3 Optional Sidewall Placement

If used:

- must be unbroken and horizontal  
- placed in the upper third of the keg  
- oriented for visibility on racks or pallets  

---

## 5. Durability Requirements

Identification elements must remain intact under:

- condensation  
- low temperatures  
- abrasion  
- transport vibration  
- stacking pressure  
- common cleaning chemicals  

Minimum durability requirement: **120 days** under normal cold-chain storage.

DraftVerify may request samples for durability verification.

---

## 6. Registry Consistency Requirements

The physical keg ID must match its DraftVerify Registry record, including:

- tag ID  
- brewery  
- product  
- batch  
- fill date / activation date  

If the keg is mislabeled or activation does not match the Registry, the keg must be:

1. quarantined  
2. corrected  
3. re-verified  

Mismatched kegs are **not compliant**.

---

## 7. Non-Compliance Conditions

A keg is considered **non-compliant** if:

- keg collar is missing or unreadable  
- coupler tag is missing  
- coupler tag does not match its Registry record  
- NA color band is incorrect  
- typography does not meet minimums  
- identifiers are obstructed  
- tag has not been activated  

Non-compliant kegs must not enter NA draft service.

---

## 8. Audit Requirements

Audits may include:

- physical inspection  
- tag activation review  
- registry reconciliation  
- durability testing  

Audit failures may result in:

- corrective actions  
- temporary removal from program  
- product recall or rework  
- reactivation review  

---
