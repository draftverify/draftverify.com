# Gas Management & Pressure Safety

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

</p>

This standard defines the **gas handling, pressure control, regulator configuration, and safety requirements** for non-alcoholic (NA) draft systems operating under the DraftVerify Standard.

NA draft products are highly sensitive to **foaming**, **over-pressurization**, and **temperature shifts**, making gas management critical to preserving service quality and identity integrity.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this standard is to:

- Ensure safe and stable gas delivery  
- Prevent over-pressurization and system damage  
- Maintain consistent pour quality across venues  
- Reduce service disruptions caused by incorrect gas settings  
- Protect staff and equipment from gas-related hazards  

Correct gas management is essential for reliable NA draft service.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

- Single-keg NA draft systems  
- Multi-tap systems  
- Mixed towers with alcoholic and NA products  
- Bars, restaurants, stadiums, and multi-venue operators  
- Any system verified under the DraftVerify Standard  

Includes requirements for:

- CO₂, Nitrogen, and blended gas types  
- Tank handling and storage  
- Regulator configuration  
- Line pressure settings  
- Leak checks  
- Safety equipment  
- Staff responsibilities  

---

## 3. Gas Types Allowed for NA Draft

### 3.1 CO₂ (100%)
Permitted when:

- Compatible with product carbonation  
- Pressure kept within manufacturer specs  

### 3.2 Nitrogen (100%)
Used for:

- Stout-style NA beers  
- Specialty systems requiring nitrogen cascading  

### 3.3 Beer Gas (CO₂/N₂ Blend)
Blends such as:

- 70/30  
- 60/40  
- 55/45  

Must match:

- Brewery recommendations  
- System design requirements  
- Regulator capabilities  

**Incorrect gas blends may cause severe NA product degradation.**

---

## 4. Tank Handling & Storage Requirements

### 4.1 Cylinder Security (Mandatory)
Gas cylinders must be:

- Secured by chain or strap  
- Stored upright  
- Kept away from heat sources  
- Not transported or rolled horizontally  

### 4.2 Label Visibility
All gas cylinders must have:

- Legible gas type labels  
- Pressure certification within valid range  

### 4.3 Separation
Store gas cylinders:

- Away from electrical equipment  
- Away from corrosive chemicals  
- In a ventilated area  

---

## 5. Regulator & Line Configuration

### 5.1 Dual-Regulator Recommended
For venues serving NA and alcoholic products:

- Separate regulators prevent crossover issues  
- NA product can be optimized individually  

### 5.2 Regulator Settings
Regulators must be:

- Clearly labeled with gas type  
- Set within brewery-provided pressure range  
- Adjusted only by trained personnel  

### 5.3 Check Valves (Required)
All NA lines must include:

- A functioning check valve  
- Installed at or near the coupler  
- Preventing backflow into shared systems  

### 5.4 Pressure Gauges
Must display:

- Tank pressure  
- Line pressure  

If unreadable → **system fails compliance**.

---

## 6. Pressure Safety Requirements

### 6.1 Safe Pressure Range
Typical operating pressure for NA draft:

- **10–14 PSI** for standard carbonated beers  
- **20–30 PSI** for nitrogenated products  

Exact values must follow brewery specifications.

### 6.2 Over-Pressurization Prevention
Signs of dangerous over-pressure:

- Excessive foaming  
- Violent pour start  
- Whistling at faucet  
- Regulator creep  

If suspected:

- Stop service  
- Shut tank valve  
- Contact system technician  

### 6.3 Emergency Shutoff
Every venue must have:

- Accessible tank shutoff valve  
- Clear labeling  
- Staff trained to close valve instantly  

---

## 7. Leak Detection & Maintenance

### 7.1 Leak Testing (Mandatory)
Check for leaks:

- At cylinder connection  
- At regulator  
- Along gas lines  
- At coupler  

Use:

- Soapy water solution **or**  
- Electronic leak detector  

### 7.2 Maintenance Frequency
Minimum:

- Monthly leak testing  
- Quarterly regulator inspection  
- Annual full-system review  

### 7.3 Component Replacement
Replace immediately if:

- Regulator creep occurs  
- Gauges flicker or stick  
- Gas smell is present  
- Hissing is observed  

---

## 8. Service Quality Standards

Correct gas management results in:

- Stable carbonation  
- Consistent pour rate  
- Reduced foaming  
- Product integrity from keg to glass  

Incorrect gas management may cause:

- Excessive foam  
- Flat or “dead” pours  
- Cloudy or hazy appearance  
- Loss of NA identity quality  

Such conditions must be logged and corrected.

---

## 9. Staff Training Requirements

Staff must be trained on:

- Gas cylinder safety  
- Regulator adjustments  
- Identifying over/under carbonation  
- Leak detection  
- Emergency shutoff  
- Product-specific gas needs  

Training occurs:

- During onboarding  
- Annually  
- When equipment changes  

---

## 10. Compliance Requirements

A system is DraftVerify-compliant only if:

- Gas type matches brewery requirements  
- Regulators are labeled and safely configured  
- Pressure settings are correct  
- Leak tests are passed  
- Cylinders are secured  
- Staff follow gas safety procedures  

Non-compliance triggers:

- Immediate corrective action  
- Safety lockout if necessary  
- Potential removal from certification  

---

## 11. Summary

The Gas Management & Pressure Safety Standard ensures:

- Proper carbonation  
- Safe operation  
- Stable pressure delivery  
- High-quality NA draft service  
- Alignment with DraftVerify identity integrity  

Correct gas management protects both **product quality** and **venue safety**.
