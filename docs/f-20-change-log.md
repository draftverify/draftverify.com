# Change Log SOP

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active  
<br>© 2025 DraftVerify™ Standards Initiative. All rights reserved.
</p>

The Change Log SOP defines uniform procedures for documenting, approving, and archiving **any change that affects the DraftVerify identity chain**, including:

- Keg identity  
- Coupler tagging  
- Line mapping  
- System configuration  
- Verification workflows  
- Venue or distributor documentation  

A consistent change log ensures traceability, auditability, and consumer safety across the DraftVerify ecosystem.

---

## 1. Purpose

This SOP ensures that:

- All changes affecting NA draft identity are recorded  
- Responsibilities are clearly assigned  
- Audit trails remain complete and tamper-resistant  
- Discrepancies can be traced to their origin  
- Regulatory and legal requirements are met  

Change logs support **risk prevention**, **investigation**, and **operational clarity**.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

- Breweries  
- Distributors  
- Venues  
- Draft system technicians  
- Third-party maintenance teams  

Covers changes to:

- Product identity records  
- Keg activation or reassignment  
- Coupler Tag installation or replacement  
- Beverage line mapping  
- Tower configuration  
- Draft system modifications  
- Verification workflow adjustments  

Does NOT cover:

- Routine line cleaning (see F-21)  
- Non-identity maintenance tasks  

---

## 3. When a Change Log Is Required

A log must be created **immediately** when any of the following occur:

### 3.1 Identity Changes  
- New DTI assigned  
- Incorrect DTI corrected  
- Keg reactivated after quarantine  
- Coupler Tag replaced  

### 3.2 System or Line Changes  
- New draft line added  
- Line reassigned to another product  
- Tower position changed  
- Equipment replaced (coupler, faucet, line segment)  

### 3.3 Verification Workflow Changes  
- New staff trained  
- Update to scanning protocol  
- Process deviations  

### 3.4 Discrepancy Resolution  
Changes made during resolution of incidents covered under **F-22 — Mis-Serve Procedure** must be logged.

---

## 4. Required Change Log Fields

Each entry must include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date & Time** | When the change occurred |
| **Location** | Brewery, distributor, or venue |
| **Responsible Person** | Name + role |
| **Type of Change** | Identity / System / Workflow / Discrepancy |
| **Before State** | What existed prior to change |
| **After State** | Updated configuration or identity |
| **DTI(s) Involved** | If applicable |
| **Reason for Change** | Why the modification was made |
| **Verification Completed?** | Yes/No + method |
| **Approver** | Supervisor or manager signature |

Logs may be stored in:

- Digital DraftVerify Registry  
- Venue or distributor logbooks  
- Brewery activation records  

---

## 5. Change Log Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify  
Staff detects a needed change (identity issue, reassignment, equipment swap, etc.).

### Step 2 — Document  
Record the change immediately using the required fields.

### Step 3 — Verify  
Confirm the new configuration by:

- NFC scan  
- Visual inspection  
- System mapping check  
- Tower/line alignment  

### Step 4 — Approve  
Supervisor or manager signs the change log.

### Step 5 — Archive  
Store the entry in local or digital records for **minimum 12 months**.

### Step 6 — Notify (If Required)  
Notify upstream or downstream partners if the change affects:

- Product routing  
- Distributor handling  
- Venue service  
- Batch traceability  

---

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities

### 6.1 Staff  
- Identify and report changes  
- Document accurately  
- Follow approval workflow  

### 6.2 Supervisors / Managers  
- Approve or reject proposed changes  
- Ensure accuracy of logs  
- Maintain archive integrity  

### 6.3 Breweries  
- Update activation records  
- Perform identity reconciliation if needed  

### 6.4 Distributors  
- Ensure traceability in transit  
- Communicate changes to venues  

### 6.5 Venues  
- Maintain accurate tower/line mapping  
- Record any keg or line changes made on-site  

---

## 7. Storage & Retention Requirements

Change logs must be:

- Stored securely  
- Accessible during audits  
- Immutable (no overwriting)  
- Retained for **minimum 12 months**  
- Digitized when possible  

For high-volume multi-venue operators (F-34), logs may need 24–36 month retention.

---

## 8. Audit Use of Change Logs

Auditors use logs to:

- Validate proper NA separation  
- Confirm correct tapping history  
- Verify identity reconciliation  
- Investigate any mis-serve or discrepancy  
- Ensure staff followed required workflows  

Missing or incomplete logs constitute **non-compliance**.

---

## 9. Common Errors (and How to Avoid Them)

- **Failure to log a keg identity correction** → Always document corrections.  
- **Replacing a Coupler Tag without record** → Must always be logged.  
- **Changing tower positions without updating mapping** → Log and update immediately.  
- **Staff forgetting approval signatures** → Managers must review daily.  

---

## 10. Summary

The Change Log SOP ensures:

- Full traceability  
- Identity integrity  
- Regulatory alignment  
- Correct system configuration  
- Clear audit trails  
- Reduced mis-serve risk  

Accurate and consistent documentation protects the venue, the distributor, the brewery, and the consumer.
