F-38 establishes a complete education and training system for **distributors** and **venues** operating under the DraftVerify Standard.  
Its purpose is to ensure every handler of non-alcoholic (NA) draft understands:

- identity protection  
- verification workflows  
- safety requirements  
- operational responsibilities  
- compliance documentation  

Education is the core mechanism that prevents mis-serve, contamination, and identity failure.
