# Keg Identification Standard

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version: 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

This document defines the **mandatory physical identification requirements** for all non-alcoholic (NA) kegs served under the DraftVerify Standard v1.0.

The keg is the **origin point** of the NA identity chain.  
Clear, durable, unambiguous identification at the keg level is required to prevent mis-serve, cross-connection, and operational error throughout the draft pathway.

<!-- SECTION 1 — PURPOSE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1. Purpose

This Standard ensures:

- NA kegs are unmistakably identifiable in mixed coolers  
- staff can visually confirm identity during changeovers  
- distributors maintain chain-of-custody accuracy  
- venues can trace NA product back to its origin  
- DraftVerify Registry identity matches the physical tag  

Keg identification is non-optional for DraftVerify compliance.

</div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 2 — REQUIRED COMPONENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 2. Required Components

Every NA keg must include the following **three** identification elements:

### 2.1 Keg Collar (Primary Identifier)

A DraftVerify-approved NA keg collar must include:

- the DraftVerify NA color band  
- the brewery name  
- product name  
- the serialized DraftVerify Tag ID  
- “NON-ALCOHOLIC DRAFT” in required typography  

### 2.2 Serialized Coupler Tag (Mandatory)

Affixed to the keg spear/coupler flange.

Must include:

- DraftVerify NA banding  
- NFC-enabled or encoded tag ID  
- matching Registry identity  

(Full encoding rules in **F-12 — Brewery NFC Tag Serialization SOP**.)

### 2.3 Optional Sidewall Identification

Used when:

- coolers stack kegs  
- visibility is reduced  
- distributors mix SKUs tightly  

May include:

- adhesive NA band  
- printed NA stripe  
- secondary QR label  

Sidewall identification is **recommended**, but not strictly required.

</div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 3 — VISUAL REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3. Visual Requirements

### 3.1 Color System (Mandatory)

NA keg identifiers must use the DraftVerify **NA Gold Band** or **NA Blue Band** (depending on program version).

Colors must meet:

- high-contrast visibility  
- non-reflective safety finish  
- minimum band height (25 mm)  

### 3.2 Typography

All NA identifiers must use:

- sans-serif, high-weight font  
- minimum height 9 mm  
- uppercase text for NA statements  

### 3.3 Required NA Statements

The keg collar must include:

**NON-ALCOHOLIC DRAFT**  
or  
**0.0% DRAFT (NON-ALCOHOLIC)**  

No substitute language is permitted.

</section>

<!-- SECTION 4 — PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Keg Collar Placement

Must be:

- fully seated  
- unobstructed  
- visible from upright and stacked positions  
- intact for the lifecycle of the keg fill  

Torn, partially applied, or low-visibility collars violate compliance.

### 4.2 Coupler Tag Placement

The coupler tag must be attached:

- directly adjacent to the spear/coupler flange  
- in a tamper-resistant position  
- within 25 mm of the engagement point  

This ensures staff identify the keg **during** changeover.

### 4.3 Sidewall Placement (If Used)

Must be:

- horizontal  
- unbroken  
- placed in the upper third of the keg surface  
- oriented for visibility on racks or pallets  

</div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 5 — DURABILITY REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5. Durability Standards

Identification must remain intact under:

- condensation  
- low temperatures  
- abrasion  
- transport vibration  
- stacking pressure  
- cleaning chemicals  

Minimum durability: **120 days** under typical cold-chain conditions.

The DraftVerify Initiative may require testing or samples for verification.

</section>

<!-- SECTION 6 — DIGITAL CONSISTENCY -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6. Digital Consistency Requirements

The physical keg ID must **match** the DraftVerify Registry record for:

- tag ID  
- product  
- batch  
- brewery  
- date of activation  

If a keg is mislabeled or inconsistently activated, the keg must be:

1. quarantined  
2. corrected  
3. re-verified  

Any mislabeled keg is **not compliant**.

</div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 7 — NON-COMPLIANCE CONDITIONS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7. Non-Compliance Conditions

A keg is **not** DraftVerify-compliant if:

- collar is missing, torn, or unreadable  
- coupler tag is missing or mismatched  
- color band is incorrect  
- identity does not match Registry  
- text is obstructed or non-standard  
- tag has not been activated  

</div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 8 — AUDIT REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 8. Audit Requirements

Audits may include:

- physical inspection  
- digital record verification  
- durability testing  
- identity reconciliation  

Audit failures may result in:

- corrective actions  
- temporary removal from DraftVerify program  
- reactivation review
