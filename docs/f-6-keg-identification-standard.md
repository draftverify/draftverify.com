# Keg Identification Standard

This standard defines the **required identification system** for non-alcoholic kegs used in DraftVerify-compliant venues, distribution networks, and brewery packaging lines.  
It governs the placement, durability, design, and digital integration of **NA keg collars and optional NFC-enabled identity points**.

Keg identification is the first element in the NA identity chain and must be implemented at the brewery before distribution.

## 1.0 Purpose of the Standard

The goal of keg identification is to ensure:
- non-alcoholic kegs are *visually unmistakable*  
- identity is **clear from any angle** in storage, transit, or cooler environments  
- staff can trace the NA product path from **keg → coupler → line → faucet**  
- keg identity persists through movement, condensation, abrasion, and handling  
- operators can verify identity even without digital tools  

Physical identity must stand on its own.  
Digital identity enhances it, but does not replace it.

## 2.0 Required Identification Components

All non-alcoholic kegs must include the following:

### 2.1 DraftVerify Keg Collar (Mandatory)
The collar is the primary NA identifier.

Minimum requirements:
- placed on the **top chime**, fully visible when stacked  
- material must be **moisture-resistant** and **tear-resistant**  
- color must use the standardized DraftVerify NA Gold (#c7aa4a)  
- must include:  
  - the NA designation  
  - brewery name  
  - product name  
  - product category  
  - batch/lot code (if used)  
  - DraftVerify mark (licensed use only)

### 2.2 Secondary Body Label (Recommended but Optional)
Sidewall label ensures visibility when:
- kegs are shelved horizontally  
- stacked 3+ high  
- viewed through cooler doors  

Placement:
- mid-to-upper body  
- clear of abrasion points  
- horizontal orientation

### 2.3 Coupler Identification Point (Mandatory unless NFC tag is used)
A bright NA marker must be present **within 3cm of the spear/valve**.

Options:
- adhesive band  
- clip-on ring  
- DraftVerify coupler tag  

Purpose:  
To stop accidental connection of alcoholic lines.

### 2.4 NFC Tag (Optional but Strongly Recommended)
If used, the NFC tag should:
- contain a **cryptographically-unique ID**  
- resolve to a **DraftVerify Registry URL**  
- be placed near the coupler for easy scanning  
- withstand moisture, abrasion, and condensate  

An NFC tag does not replace the collar.  
Both must exist.

## 3.0 Placement Standards

### 3.1 Collar Placement
The collar must:
- sit flat and tight against the top chime  
- not be obscured by handles, stacking, or shrink film  
- be readable from at least 1 meter  

### 3.2 Sidewall Placement
Sidewall label must:
- avoid seam welds and scrape zones  
- be visible when kegs are palletized  
- be straight, not angled  

### 3.3 Coupler Placement
The NA coupler marking must be:
- immediately adjacent to the valve  
- compatible with all S-type, D-type, and G-type couplers  
- visible **before** attachment, not after  

### 3.4 NFC Placement (If Used)
The NFC tag should be:
- on the top dome, near the spear  
- not placed under or near metallic obstructions  
- accessible while the keg is in-place

## 4.0 Durability Requirements

Identification components must survive:
- condensation cycles  
- cold storage (0°C to 4°C)  
- pallet movement  
- keg washer heat exposure (collars removed before washing)  
- loading and unloading impacts  

Labels must resist:
- tearing  
- smearing  
- ink migration  
- peeling under friction  

DraftVerify provides approved artwork templates for consistent identity use.

## 5.0 Brewery Responsibilities

Breweries must:
- apply all mandatory identifiers before the keg leaves the facility  
- ensure information is accurate and legible  
- maintain serialization and batch records  
- activate NFC tags (if used)  
- document keg preparation in brewery logs  
- prevent reuse of NA collars on alcoholic kegs  

Once labeled, NA identity must remain intact until the keg is empty and returned.

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Venue & Distributor Responsibilities

Venues and distributors must:
- reject unlabeled or improperly labeled NA kegs  
- report damaged or missing identifiers  
- preserve collar integrity during handling  
- ensure coupler markers remain present  
- log exceptions in DraftVerify records  

Keg identity must remain intact through the entire supply chain.

## 7.0 Prohibited Practices

The following actions violate DraftVerify Standard v1.0:

- mixing NA collars with alcoholic products  
- using handwritten markers as primary identification  
- covering NA markers with tape or wrap  
- using digital-only identification  
- applying collars post-distribution  
- removing collars prematurely  

Non-compliance must be documented and reported.
