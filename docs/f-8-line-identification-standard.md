# Line Identification Standard

DraftVerify establishes the first **global line-identification system** for draft beverages.  
This standard defines how to **label, verify, and protect** the identity of beverage lines from keg to faucet using physical tags, NFC-enabled markers, and the DraftVerify Registry.

Proper line identification protects:
- **Safety** (critical for non-alcoholic draft)
- **Cross-contamination prevention**
- **Loss reduction + accuracy**
- **Brand integrity for breweries**
- **Operational clarity for venues**

---

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this standard is to ensure that every draft line has:
1. A **clear physical identifier** visible to staff and auditors  
2. A **digital identity** tied to a cryptographically-unique NFC ID  
3. A **direct mapping** between the keg, the coupler, the line, and the faucet  

This system provides a single source of truth for what is flowing through each tap at any given time.

---

## 2. Scope
This standard applies to:
- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Breweries  
- Stadiums & arenas  
- Distributor-managed draft systems  
- Any venue using DraftVerify for NA or alcoholic draft  

It covers:
- Line tags  
- Coupler tags  
- Optional tower markers  
- NFC-enabled identity points  

---

## 3. Components of the Line Identification System

### 3.1 Line Tag (Primary Identifier)
A **durable, high-contrast physical tag** placed on the beverage line near the coupler.  
The tag displays:
- Product name  
- Style (if applicable)  
- Colour-coded category  
- Matching NFC ID code (non-scannable printed shorthand)

This is the **first visual cue** staff see when connecting a keg.

### 3.2 Coupler Tag (NFC Identity Point)
A small, tamper-resistant NFC tag placed near the keg valve.  
Used to:
- Confirm identity before tapping  
- Validate NA vs alcoholic  
- Link keg → coupler → line in the Registry  
- Tie into audit logs  

This is the **digital verification point**.

### 3.3 Tower Marker (Optional)
A small identifier placed at the faucet head.  
Useful for:
- High-volume bars  
- Stadium service  
- Multi-shift venues  
- Fast or rotating staff environments  

This is an **optional redundancy layer**, not required for standard compliance.

---

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Line Tag Placement
- Must be placed **within the first 12–18 inches** from the coupler.  
- Must be **forward-facing** and readable when reaching into the cooler.  
- Must not obstruct movement, cooling, or cleaning.

### 4.2 Coupler Tag Placement
- Placed on or near the coupler body.  
- Must be accessible for NFC scanning **before tap connection**.  
- Must not interfere with keg valves or seals.

### 4.3 Tower Marker Placement (Optional)
- Placed above or behind the faucet.  
- Must be visible from bartending position.  
- Not required for F-8 compliance.

---

## 5. Identification Hierarchy  
The following hierarchy ensures clarity and traceability:

### 5.1 Primary Identifier  
**Line Tag** → what staff see first  

### 5.2 Verification Point  
**Coupler NFC Tag** → what staff must scan before tapping  

### 5.3 Service-Side Indicator (Optional)  
**Tower Marker** → what staff see at the faucet  

This hierarchy ensures the correct product is flowing through the correct line **before**, **during**, and **after** service.

---

## 6. Standardized Colour Coding

| Category | Colour | Required |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Non-Alcoholic (NA) | Gold | Mandatory |
| Alcoholic | Blue | Recommended |
| Seasonal / Rotational | Teal | Optional |
| House / Staff-Only | Grey | Optional |

Gold for NA is **non-negotiable** under the DraftVerify NA Standard.  
Visual distinction is essential for preventing mis-taps.

---

## 7. NFC Verification Workflow

### Step 1 — Connect  
Staff sees the **line tag** when reaching for the coupler.

### Step 2 — Scan  
Staff scans the **NFC coupler tag** using any NFC-capable phone.

### Step 3 — Confirm  
Phone displays:
- Brewery  
- Product  
- Category (NA or alcoholic)  
- Notes (if provided by brewery or distributor)

### Step 4 — Serve  
Once validated, the keg is tapped and service begins.

Each scan creates an **immutable audit log entry** tied to that specific NFC ID.

---

## 8. Brewery & Distributor Responsibilities

Breweries must:
- Apply coupler tags to NA kegs (minimum requirement)  
- Maintain accurate product-to-tag assignments  
- Provide venues with accurate line tag artwork  

Distributors must:
- Ensure line tags match delivered product  
- Confirm coupler NFC tags are present and readable  
- Report inconsistencies to DraftVerify  

Venues must:
- Apply line tags correctly  
- Use NFC verification when tapping  
- Maintain basic cleanliness and visibility of identifiers  

---

## 9. Compliance Requirements
A venue is compliant when all of the following are true:
- Every NA line has a **Line Tag**  
- Every NA keg has a **Coupler NFC Tag**  
- Tags match the actual product being served  
- All NFC tags are registered and active  
- Staff verify identity before connecting new kegs  

Optional components (tower markers) do not affect compliance.

---

## 10. Rationale
Correct line identification solves fundamental industry risks:
- Wrong beer on the wrong line  
- Cross-contamination (especially NA)  
- Brand misrepresentation  
- Revenue leakage from mis-pours  
- Staff turnover → training gaps  
- Distributor disputes over what was actually on tap  

DraftVerify standardizes what has never been standardized.

The result:
**No guesswork. No mistakes. No ambiguity.**

A fully identified draft system builds trust from brewery → distributor → venue → consumer.

---

## 11. Future-Proofing & Extensions
This standard is designed to scale as:
- NA draft volumes grow  
- NFC technology becomes more common  
- Breweries add more SKUs  
- Distributors adopt unified regional systems  
- Venues move toward digital tap menus  

Future capabilities may include:
- Full tap-to-keg verification  
- Automated rotation tracking  
- Digital line cleaning logs  
- Real-time pour identity mapping  

---

## 12. Summary
The Line Identification Standard ensures that every beverage line is:
- **Clear**  
- **Consistent**  
- **Verified**  
- **Digitally traceable**  

DraftVerify turns an industry built on habit and tradition into one built on **clarity and accountability** — without slowing down service or complicating workflow.
