# Beer Line Identification Standard

This standard defines the **mandatory identification requirements for non-alcoholic (NA) beer lines** used in DraftVerify-compliant systems.

Beer lines are the **longest, least visible, and most failure-prone link** in the NA identity chain.  
Correct line identification ensures staff, auditors, and technicians can follow the NA draft path from **keg → coupler → line → tower → faucet** without guesswork or ambiguity.

## 1.0 Purpose

The Beer Line Identification Standard ensures:

- NA lines are unmistakably marked along their entire length  
- staff can visually trace the NA pathway even in dense cooler setups  
- cross-contact between alcoholic and NA products is prevented  
- operators can verify the correct line during installation, cleaning, or troubleshooting  
- digital records map to physical identity points  

Line tags are required elements of DraftVerify Standard v1.0 and may not be omitted.

## 2.0 Required Identification Components

Every NA line must include the following:

### 2.1 Line Tags (Mandatory)
Durable, clearly visible NA tags spaced along the full line.

Minimum properties:
- NA Gold (#c7aa4a) color  
- high-contrast text or symbols  
- moisture and chemical resistance  
- no sharp edges  
- non-removable without tools  
- compatible with coils, bundles, and trunk lines  

Approved formats:
- clip-on ID rings  
- adhesive NA bands  
- wrap-around polymer flags  
- fixed ID plates  

### 2.2 Line Header Tag (Mandatory)
A large, high-visibility NA tag must be placed:

- within **10 cm** of the coupler end  
- readable during all keg swaps  
- facing outward toward staff  

### 2.3 Mid-Line Identification (Mandatory)
Tags must be spaced at:

- **every 1.0–1.5 meters** for direct-draw systems  
- **every 1.5–2.0 meters** for long-draw trunk systems  

Distance may be reduced in dense routing environments.

### 2.4 Tower Entry Tag (Mandatory)
A tag must be positioned at the **tower entrance** or shank connection to confirm the correct NA line enters the tower.

### 2.5 NFC Line Tag (Optional)
If NFC is used:

- the tag must contain a unique ID  
- the ID must resolve to a registry record  
- placement must allow field scanning  
- tag must withstand trunk line compression  

NFC is optional but strongly recommended for multi-venue operators.

## 3.0 Placement Requirements

### 3.1 General Placement Rules
Line tags must be:

- upright and legible  
- unobstructed by insulation  
- placed on the **visible outer layer** when multiple lines are bundled  
- consistent in orientation  
- installed before routing where possible  

### 3.2 Bundled/Trunk Lines
For trunk lines:

- NA line must be identified at entry, midpoint, and exit  
- identification must remain readable without removing insulation  
- tag must not interfere with glycol lines or trunk compression  

### 3.3 Vertical Runs
Tags must be spaced more frequently if:

- lines run vertically more than 1.5 meters  
- lines pass through multiple elevation changes  

### 3.4 Cooler Ceilings and Racks
If lines run overhead:

- tags must face downward or outward  
- tags must be placed before and after any obstruction  

### 3.5 Tower Entry
The tower entry tag must be:

- directly above the shank  
- visible without moving foam, insulation, or other lines  
- readable during faucet service

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Durability Requirements

Line identification must withstand:

- condensation and freeze/thaw cycles  
- chemical cleaners (alkaline and acid)  
- CO₂/N₂ exposure  
- abrasion from routing and cooler traffic  
- compression from other lines  
- long-term tension and flex  

Tags must remain legible for at least **12 months** under normal operating conditions.

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5.0 Brewery Responsibilities

Breweries must:

- include a line ID reference with each NA keg shipment  
- specify the product’s intended line designation  
- ensure line tags match keg and coupler tags  
- provide full routing diagrams for multi-venue programs  

Breweries may not rely on venue staff to determine NA routing without guidance.

<!-- SECTION 6 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Venue Responsibilities

Venues must:

- tag all NA lines according to this standard  
- inspect tags during every keg change  
- replace damaged or missing tags immediately  
- map the NA line number in DraftVerify records  
- ensure cleaning crews respect NA identification  
- ensure alcoholic lines never use NA markers  

Venues that do not maintain line identification lose DraftVerify compliance.

<!-- SECTION 7 -->

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7.0 Prohibited Practices

The following violate DraftVerify Standard v1.0:

- placing tags under insulation  
- handwritten tags or tape  
- using NA tags on alcoholic lines  
- covering tags with foam wrap  
- placing tags on trunkline glycol tubes  
- using non-durable label stock  
- placing tags only at one end of the line  

Any violation must be logged as an **exception event**.
