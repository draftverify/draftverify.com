# Line Identification Standard

The Line Identification Standard defines how draft beverage lines must be labeled, verified, and mapped to the correct product.  
This standard ensures clarity from the keg in the cooler to the faucet on the tower, reducing errors, preventing cross-contamination, and supporting the DraftVerify verification layer.

Line identification protects:
- Product accuracy  
- Safety (critical for non-alcoholic draft)  
- Brand integrity  
- Operational consistency  
- Delivery and distributor accountability  

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this standard is to establish a **universal and consistent method** for identifying beverage lines using:

- Physical line tags  
- Optional tower markers  
- NFC-coupler tag verification  
- A clear mapping between keg → coupler → line → faucet  

This system ensures the correct product is always flowing through the correct line.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:
- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Breweries  
- Stadiums and large venues  
- Distributors managing draft programs  
- Any operation using DraftVerify for NA or alcoholic draft

Covers:
- Line tags  
- Placement rules  
- Optional tower markers  
- Category color coding  
- Verification workflows  
- Compliance criteria  

---

## 3. Components of the Identification System

### 3.1 Line Tag (Primary Identifier)
A durable physical tag attached to the beverage line near the coupler.  
It displays:
- Product name  
- Category color  
- Optional style text  
- A short alphanumeric code matching the NFC record (not a URL)

This is the **primary visual identifier**.

### 3.2 Coupler Tag (Digital Verification Point)
An NFC-enabled tag applied to the coupler area.  
Used to:
- Confirm product identity  
- Validate NA vs alcoholic  
- Link keg to line in the registry  
- Support audit logging  

This is the **digital identity point** for DraftVerify.

### 3.3 Tower Marker (Optional)
A small identifier placed on or near the faucet.  
Useful for:
- High-volume venues  
- Stadium service  
- Rotating staff environments  

Not required for compliance.

---

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Line Tag Placement
Line tags must be:
- Attached within the first 30–45 cm (12–18 inches) from the coupler  
- Facing outward for readability  
- Secure but removable for maintenance  
- Clear of sharp bends or heat sources  

### 4.2 Coupler Tag Placement
Coupler tags:
- Must be applied on or beside the coupler body  
- Must be scannable before connection  
- Must not obstruct keg operation  

(Full details in F-7.)

### 4.3 Tower Marker Placement (Optional)
Tower markers may be placed:
- On the faucet collar  
- Behind the faucet on the tower  
- Near digital tap displays  

Not required for F-8 compliance.

---

## 5. Identification Hierarchy

To ensure clarity, the following hierarchy must be followed:

1. **Primary Identifier:** Line Tag  
2. **Verification Check:** Coupler NFC Tag  
3. **Service-Side Indicator (Optional):** Tower Marker  

This ensures the beverage is identified correctly at every interaction point.

---

## 6. Category Color Coding

Color coding supports rapid recognition and safety.

| Category | Color | Requirement |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Non-Alcoholic (NA) | Gold | Mandatory |
| Alcoholic | Blue | Recommended |
| Seasonal / Rotational | Teal | Optional |
| House / Staff | Grey | Optional |

Gold for NA lines is **mandatory** to prevent mis-tapping.

---

## 7. Verification Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify  
Staff locates the correct **Line Tag** in the cooler.

### Step 2 — Verify  
Staff taps the **Coupler Tag** with an NFC-enabled phone.

The phone displays:
- Brewery  
- Product identity  
- Category (NA clearly indicated)  
- Any additional notes  

### Step 3 — Connect  
After confirmation, staff connect the coupler.

### Step 4 — Audit (Automatic)  
Each scan is stored in the DraftVerify Registry.

---

## 8. Responsibilities

### 8.1 Breweries
- Provide accurate line tag information  
- Supply correct category colors  
- Maintain consistent product naming  

### 8.2 Distributors
- Ensure correct line tags accompany deliveries  
- Verify coupler tags remain intact  
- Report inconsistencies  

### 8.3 Venues
- Apply line tags according to this standard  
- Verify kegs with NFC before tapping  
- Maintain clear and visible identifiers  
- Update tags when lines change  

---

## 9. Compliance Requirements

A venue is considered **F-8 compliant** when:
- Each draft line has a Line Tag attached  
- All NA draft lines use gold category coloring  
- All NA kegs have a coupler NFC tag  
- Staff verify identity before connecting new kegs  
- Optional tower markers are properly placed (where used)  

---

## 10. Rationale

Line identification solves long-standing industry pain points:
- Wrong line used for the wrong product  
- Cross-contamination (especially NA)  
- Brand misrepresentation  
- Distributors blamed for incorrect products  
- Staff turnover creating inconsistent tapping practices  

DraftVerify unifies this into a single, intuitive system.

---

## 11. Summary

The Line Identification Standard ensures each draft product is clearly, consistently, and verifiably identified from cooler to faucet.  
Physical tags create clarity.  
Digital verification ensures certainty.  
Together, they produce a safer, more reliable, and more accountable draft ecosystem.
