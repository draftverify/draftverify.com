# Faucet Identification Standard

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version: 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

Faucet identification is the consumer-facing layer of the DraftVerify ecosystem.  
It ensures that the beverage being poured matches the beverage being advertised — a critical requirement for **non-alcoholic (NA)** products where mis-serve carries safety, legal, and reputational risks.

This Standard defines the visual and optional digital identification required at the **point of pour**.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Faucet Identification Standard:

- provides unambiguous product identity at the faucet  
- prevents NA/alcoholic confusion  
- enhances consumer trust and brand accuracy  
- allows staff to easily confirm what is on tap  
- supports DraftVerify’s full keg → tap verification chain  

Faucet identity reinforces what the consumer sees, what the operator serves, and what the registry verifies.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to all draft faucets serving:

- non-alcoholic (mandatory)  
- alcoholic (optional but recommended)  
- rotational / seasonal products  
- multi-venue or high-volume programs  

Includes:

- faucet-side identifiers  
- optional digital tap markers  
- placement rules  
- color systems  
- identity hierarchy  

---

## 3. Components of Faucet Identification

### 3.1 Faucet Collar Marker (Primary Identifier)
A small, durable marker placed around or adjacent to the faucet.

Must include:

- product name  
- category color (gold for NA)  
- optional style text  

This is the **primary point-of-pour identifier**.

### 3.2 Digital Faucet Marker (Optional)
Venues may use digital displays, LCD tap heads, or POS-linked screens.

Recommended display information:

- brewery  
- product name  
- category  
- ABV or “0.0%” for NA  

### 3.3 Tower Marker (Optional)
Larger signage placed on:

- tower faceplate  
- tap bank  
- menu board above draft lines  

Not required for compliance.

---

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Faucet Collar Placement
The collar or marker must be:

- on the faucet neck, tap handle base, or adjacent collar  
- visible from the pouring position  
- readable by consumers at typical bar distance  
- durable under moisture and cleaning  

### 4.2 Digital Marker Placement (If Used)
Digital screens must be:

- positioned near the faucet  
- visible to staff and consumers  
- updated automatically when product switches  

### 4.3 Tower Marker Placement (Optional)
Recommended for:

- stadiums  
- busy bars  
- multi-handle towers  

---

## 5. Identification Hierarchy

Faucet identity follows the DraftVerify hierarchy:

1. **Primary Identifier:** Faucet Marker  
2. **Verification Point:** Coupler Tag (NFC)  
3. **Service Indicator:** Line Tag  
4. **Keg-Origin Identity:** Keg Collar  

This ensures identity is preserved from keg → coupler → line → faucet.

---

## 6. Category Color System

| Category | Color | Requirement |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Non-Alcoholic (NA) | Gold | **Mandatory** |
| Alcoholic | Blue | Recommended |
| Seasonal / Rotational | Teal | Optional |
| House / Staff Lines | Grey | Optional |

Gold must always represent NA at the faucet.

---

## 7. Rationale for Faucet Identification

Faucet identity is critical because:

- it is the **last point** before the product reaches the glass  
- consumers visually confirm what they ordered  
- new staff heavily rely on faucet markers  
- misidentification at the faucet leads to mis-serve  
- NA consumers expect absolute clarity  

A single mis-serve at the faucet can cause:

- safety incidents  
- customer complaints  
- social media backlash  
- lost contracts  
- regulatory attention  

Faucet identity is therefore a mandatory component of NA draft safety.

---

## 8. Compliance Requirements

A venue is **F-9 compliant** when:

- each faucet has a clear, durable faucet marker  
- NA faucets use **gold** category coloration  
- faucet markers match Line Tags and Coupler Tags  
- operators update markers when switching products  
- markers remain visible and intact  

Optional digital displays enhance compliance but do not replace physical identity.

---

## 9. Responsibilities

### Breweries
- supply accurate product names  
- approve category color usage  
- provide template faucet markers  

### Distributors
- ensure correct faucet markers accompany deliveries  
- replace lost or damaged markers  

### Venues
- place faucet markers correctly  
- update markers immediately upon keg change  
- use DraftVerify verification steps before tapping  

---

## 10. Summary

The Faucet Identification Standard establishes the final visual checkpoint of the DraftVerify identity chain.

By standardizing faucet markers, DraftVerify:

- prevents NA/alcoholic mis-serve  
- strengthens consumer trust  
- improves staff accuracy  
- creates a consistent national identity system  
- connects the full keg → tap verification loop  

Clear at the keg.  
Verified at the coupler.  
Mapped at the line.  
Correct at the faucet.
