This document provides breweries with the **complete implementation workflow** required to adopt the DraftVerify Standard.  

It covers:  
- NA keg preparation  
- physical tagging  
- digital activation  
- NA-only handling procedures  
- documentation requirements  
- compliance expectations  

This guide ensures breweries can achieve **full DraftVerify compliance** with minimal operational friction.

## 1.0 Purpose of This Guide

This implementation guide gives breweries a **repeatable, standardized workflow** for:

- preparing NA draft products  
- attaching physical identification  
- activating serialized tags  
- ensuring NA-only handling  
- producing compliant documentation  
- passing DraftVerify verification audits  

This guide is required reading for any brewery shipping NA draft products.

## 2.0 Pre-Implementation Requirements

Before adopting DraftVerify, breweries must ensure:

### **2.1 Production Readiness**
- Non-alcoholic products must be fully compliant with regulatory definitions  
- Dedicated NA production areas strongly recommended  
- Batch tracking infrastructure is in place  

### **2.2 Operational Readiness**
- Staff assigned to NA handling  
- Devices available for NFC activation  
- WiFi or cellular coverage in kegging area  

### **2.3 Storage & Handling**
- NA-only storage zones identified  
- Clear segregation from alcoholic kegs  
- Temperature-controlled cold storage available

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 3.0 Keg Preparation (NA Only)

Breweries must ensure:

- kegs are cleaned and sanitized according to NA protocols  
- kegs are clearly separated from alcoholic kegs at all times  
- all tools, hoses, and manifolds used in NA production are NA-only  

Any cross-contact invalidates DraftVerify compliance.

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Physical Tagging Requirements

Each keg must receive:

1. **NA Keg Collar** (per F-6)  
2. **NFC Coupler Tag** (per F-7)  
3. **Optional sidewall identifier** (for facilities with stacked storage)  

Tagging must occur **before** any movement out of NA-only storage.

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 5.0 Digital Activation Process

Digital activation must follow F-13 and includes:

- scanning the NFC tag  
- validating the serial number  
- linking keg → batch → product  
- logging activation timestamp  
- recording staff ID  
- verifying NA-only handling conditions  

Unactivated tags are not compliant and must never leave the brewery.

<!-- SECTION 6 -->

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Brewery Workflow Overview

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. Prepare NA keg in NA-only production zone  
2. Apply keg collar  
3. Apply NFC coupler tag  
4. Encode NFC tag (F-12)  
5. Digitally activate the identity (F-13)  
6. Move keg to NA-only cold storage  
7. Complete documentation (F-14)  
8. Release product to NA-compliant distributor  

Breweries may not skip or reorder steps.

<!-- SECTION 7 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7.0 Compliance Documentation

Breweries must maintain:

- serialization logs  
- activation logs  
- batch tracking metadata  
- NA handling and segregation logs  
- temperature records  
- shipping chain-of-custody  

Documentation requirements are specified in **F-14 Brewery Documentation & Records.**

<!-- SECTION 8 -->

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 8.0 Distributor Handoff Requirements

Before handing off kegs, breweries must:

- verify all tags are active  
- attach transport documentation  
- provide distributor with NA-only routing expectations  
- confirm proper cold chain conditions  

Distributors receiving unverified kegs must reject them.

<!-- SECTION 9 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 9.0 Annual Verification Renewal

Breweries must complete:

- self-audit checklist  
- serialization and activation compliance review  
- NA-only storage and handling verification  
- DraftVerify audit (if applicable)  

Failure to renew results in temporary suspension of certification.
