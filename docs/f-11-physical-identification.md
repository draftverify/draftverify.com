This document defines the **mandatory physical identification system** required for any DraftVerify-compliant non-alcoholic draft installation.  

It includes:  
- keg identification  
- coupler identification  
- trunk line identification  
- faucet & tower identification  
- visibility requirements  
- durability requirements  
- inspection & replacement rules  

Together, these create the universal physical language of non-alcoholic draft integrity.

## 1.0 Purpose

The physical identification system ensures that non-alcoholic draft components are:

- **instantly recognizable**
- **clearly separated** from alcoholic draft paths
- **consistent** across all venues and operators
- **easy to verify** against the digital registry
- **resistant** to wear, condensation, abrasion, and cooler environments

DraftVerify’s physical identification layer forms one half of the compliance framework; the digital registry completes it.

## 2.0 General Requirements (Mandatory)

All NA draft equipment must:

- display **DraftVerify Gold (#C7AA4A)** as the primary identification color  
- display the **Circle-NA symbol** defined in the Visual Lexicon  
- maintain visibility from at least:  
  - 1m on kegs  
  - 0.5m on couplers  
  - 2m at faucets  
- use **durable, water-resistant, cooler-safe materials**
- be **intact, legible, and not tampered with**

Any missing, faded, or damaged identifier must be replaced immediately.

## 3.0 Keg Identification Requirements

Every NA keg must include:

### 3.1 NA Keg Collar (Mandatory)
- Circular, full 360° wrap  
- Primary color: DraftVerify Gold  
- Symbol: Circle-NA  
- Minimum diameter: 180–200mm  
- Must not be obstructed by shrink wrap or keg caps  
- Must remain readable under:  
  - condensation  
  - frosting  
  - stacking  

### 3.2 Serialized Tag Area
A designated region must be available for:
- NFC-enabled keg tag  
- printed serial reference  
- activation sticker if applicable

### 3.3 What May NOT Appear
- handwritten NA identifiers  
- tape-based solutions  
- altered or custom colors  
- brewery-specific NA markings that conflict with DraftVerify visuals

## 4.0 Coupler Identification Requirements

Couplers must feature a **high-visibility wrap** or **clip-on marker** in DraftVerify Gold.

### 4.1 Required Features
- Color: DraftVerify Gold  
- Symbol: Circle-NA  
- Minimum size: visible at 0.5m  
- 360° visibility strongly recommended  

### 4.2 Approved Formats
- silicone band  
- clamp-on coupler tag  
- molded clip  
- adhesive wrap band  

### 4.3 Placement
- Must be visible from above and from the hose connection view  
- Must not interfere with cleaning or coupler operation

## 5.0 Line Identification Requirements

Lines must be marked along their entire NA path.

### 5.1 Tag Types
DraftVerify-approved line markers include:
- wrap-around flag tags  
- pattern-based NA strips  
- elongated rectangular identity bands  
- embedded-pattern sleeves  

### 5.2 Tag Spacing
Minimum spacing:
- **every 1 meter**, or  
- at every choke point, bend, or clip  

### 5.3 Cooler Routing
When lines run in bundles, NA lines must be:
- visually distinct  
- physically separated when possible  
- identified before & after the trunkline jacket  

### 5.4 Prohibited Practices
- marker pens  
- tape-based markings  
- non-standard colors

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Faucet & Tower Identification Requirements

### 6.1 Faucet Marker
Each NA faucet must display:
- Circle-NA symbol  
- DraftVerify Gold background  
- Minimum diameter: **16mm**  

### 6.2 Tower Marker
If towers contain mixed alcoholic + NA lines:
- a DraftVerify Gold tower badge must be present  
- badge must be visible from customer side  

### 6.3 Customer-Facing Visibility
Patrons must be able to identify an NA tap without staff assistance.

### 6.4 Multi-Tap Towers
When multiple NA lines appear on a single tower:
- each faucet is individually marked  
- a single tower badge is not enough

## 7.0 Maintenance & Replacement Rules

Identification elements must be replaced when:

- faded  
- damaged  
- peeling  
- obstructed  
- cracked  
- unreadable  
- covered by other materials  

Replacement must occur **within 24 hours** of detection.

Venues must maintain:
- spare coupler bands  
- spare faucet markers  
- spare line tags  
- spare keg collars (if applicable)

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 8.0 Alignment With Digital Registry

All physical tags must correspond to:

- active digital activation  
- correct serial numbers  
- correct keg → line → faucet mapping  

If the digital registry does not match the physical identifiers, the system is **not DraftVerify compliant**.
