This document establishes the **requirements and restrictions** for serving **non-alcoholic (NA)** draft products on a tower that also dispenses alcoholic beverages ("shared towers").

Tower sharing is permitted under the DraftVerify Standard **only when identity controls, separation rules, and verification workflows are strictly followed**.

NA mis-serve risk is highest on shared towers, making this one of the most sensitive sections of the entire DraftVerify ecosystem.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this standard is to:

- Prevent NA ↔ alcoholic mis-serves  
- Ensure correct identity on shared towers  
- Provide clear visual & operational separation  
- Define compliance for mixed-product towers  
- Reduce risk in high-turnover and high-volume environments  
- Ensure DraftVerify identity chain remains intact  

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Stadiums  
- Breweries  
- Event venues  
- Multi-venue operations  

Covers:

- Identity placement  
- Physical separation rules  
- Faucet identification  
- Line routing  
- Verification workflow requirements  
- Staff responsibilities  

Excludes:

- Dedicated NA-only towers (handled by F-24 and F-18)  

---

## 3. Tower Sharing Principles

Tower sharing is allowed **only** when:

1. NA identity is unmistakable at every interaction point  
2. NA lines are verified before every keg change  
3. Faucet labels cannot be confused or swapped  
4. Staff are trained to understand NA risks (F-23)  
5. System design supports separation (F-24)  

Failure to meet these principles = **tower cannot be shared**.

---

## 4. Identity Requirements for Shared Towers

### 4.1 Faucet Identification (Mandatory)
The NA faucet must include:

- A DraftVerify NA identity marker  
- Gold category color  
- Clear text: **NON-ALCOHOLIC** or **0.0%**  

### 4.2 Tower Marker Placement
Markers must be:

- On the faucet collar **or**  
- On tower face directly behind faucet  
- In a fixed, tamper-resistant position  

### 4.3 Line Tag Consistency
Line tags must match:

- Coupler tag identity  
- Verification results  
- Venue line map (F-18)  

### 4.4 Handle Restriction  
DraftVerify recommends:

- Using a **unique NA-only tap handle**  
- Avoiding handles resembling alcoholic brands  

---

## 5. Physical Separation Rules

### 5.1 Spatial Separation
NA faucets must not be placed:

- Between two alcoholic taps  
- In clusters that obscure identification  

Preferred placement:

- **Edge of tower**  
- **Distinct vertical spacing**  

### 5.2 Visual Separation
At least one form of NA emphasis must be present:

- Colored handle  
- Colored faucet marker  
- Gold banding  
- Prominent NA signage  

### 5.3 Proximity Hazards  
Avoid placing NA taps:

- Next to rotating seasonal taps  
- Next to unlabeled faucets  
- On towers with frequent handle swapping  

These situations require elevated control.

---

## 6. Line Routing Requirements

### 6.1 Unique Routing Path
NA lines must:

- Follow a clearly identifiable route  
- Never cross-connect with alcoholic lines  
- Be marked with NA Gold in cooler  

### 6.2 Accessibility
ALL NA identity components must be accessible:

- Line tag (F-8)  
- Coupler tag (F-7)  
- Keg collar (F-6)  

### 6.3 Documentation
Routing must be recorded in the Venue Setup Map (F-18).

---

## 7. Verification Workflow Requirements

### Step 1 — Identify Line Tag  
Staff confirms correct NA line in cooler.

### Step 2 — NFC Scan  
Scan coupler tag before tapping.

Must display:

- Brewery  
- Product  
- Category: **Non-Alcoholic**  
- Active tag status  

### Step 3 — Confirm Faucet  
The faucet identity must match the product verified.

### Step 4 — Connect Keg  
Only after visual + digital confirmation.

### Step 5 — Service Checks  
Throughout shift:

- Ensure NA faucet identity remains visible  
- Ensure no handle or label swapping  
- Confirm correct tap is used  

---

## 8. Staff Responsibilities

### 8.1 Opening Duties
- Confirm NA faucet labeling  
- Confirm no alcoholic product is on NA line  
- Scan any newly installed keg  

### 8.2 Mid-Shift Duties
- Monitor tower for mislabeling  
- Watch for swapped handles  
- Re-check identity if any doubts arise  

### 8.3 Closing Duties
- Inspect NA faucet  
- Document any identity concerns  
- Report unusual taste or flow issues  

---

## 9. Risk Mitigation Measures

Shared towers inherently increase mis-serve risk.

Venues should adopt:

### 9.1 Redundant Identity
Use **two or more** of the following:

- Gold faucet decals  
- NA-specific tap handle  
- NA signage on tower  
- Gold line wraps in cooler  

### 9.2 Restricted Staff Access
Only trained staff (F-23) should:

- Change kegs  
- Swap handles  
- Perform line reassignments  

### 9.3 Avoid Tower Sharing in High-Risk Venues
Examples:

- Nightclubs  
- High-turnover stadium bars  
- Festivals  
- Dark/low-light environments  

In these cases, DraftVerify recommends a **dedicated NA tower**.

---

## 10. Incident Handling on Shared Towers

If any identity issue occurs:

- Follow **F-22 Incident Response**  
- Immediately stop service  
- Quarantine affected keg  
- Re-verify line routing  
- Retrain staff if needed  

Shared towers require **zero-tolerance** for identity ambiguity.

---

## 11. Compliance Requirements

A venue is DraftVerify-compliant only if:

- NA faucet is unmistakably marked  
- NA line is correctly routed and tagged  
- Identity chain is intact (keg → coupler → line → faucet)  
- Verification is performed every keg change  
- Staff training is complete  
- No alcoholic product has ever run on the NA line since last sanitation  

Non-compliance triggers:

- Corrective action  
- Possible removal from DraftVerify certification  
- Increased audit frequency  

---

## 12. Summary

The Tower Sharing Standard ensures:

- Clear NA identification  
- Safe and accurate draft service  
- Reduced mis-serve risk  
- Proper physical and operational separation  
- Compatibility with the full DraftVerify identity system  

Shared towers are permissible — but only when identity is unmistakable, verification is consistent, and risk controls are strictly maintained.
