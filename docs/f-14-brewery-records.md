# Brewery Documentation & Records

This document defines the **recordkeeping requirements** for breweries participating in the DraftVerify Standard.  
Accurate documentation ensures traceability, accountability, and regulatory alignment across the entire NA draft ecosystem.

DraftVerify does **not** replace brewery QA/QC systems — it enhances them by adding a technology-backed identity layer for non-alcoholic (NA) draft.

---

## 1. Purpose of Documentation

Brewery documentation supports:

- Accurate identity mapping for each keg  
- Traceability from brewery → distributor → venue  
- Audit readiness for DraftVerify or regulatory reviews  
- Incident investigation (mis-serve, contamination, tampering)  
- Product recall or batch tracking  
- Verification accuracy downstream  

Good documentation ensures the NA ecosystem is **safe, consistent, and trusted**.

---

## 2. Required Brewery Records

Breweries must maintain the following DraftVerify-related records.

### 2.1 Activation Logs
Every activated NA keg must have:

- DraftVerify Tag ID (DTI)  
- Activation timestamp  
- Product identity  
- Batch/lot code  
- Keg size  
- Packaging date  
- Staff initials or login used during activation  

Activation Logs are created automatically in the DraftVerify Registry but must also be retained internally.

### 2.2 Batch Records
Each batch of NA product must include:

- Full recipe/process reference  
- Batch code or lot number  
- Filtration/centrifuge logs  
- Packaging date(s)  
- QA test results (ABV < 0.5% confirmation recommended)  
- Packaging yield  
- Disposition notes (approved, partial, rework, held)  

DraftVerify does not require ABV paperwork but strongly encourages retaining it.

### 2.3 Tag Inventory Logs
Breweries must track:

- How many Coupler Tags were issued  
- Which products they were designated for  
- Which DTIs were applied  
- Unused tags  
- Damaged or retired tags  

Tag inventory logs prevent mis-assignments.

### 2.4 Non-Conformance Records
Any identity-related issue must be logged:

- Wrong product tagged  
- Incorrect batch information entered  
- Tag lost or damaged before activation  
- Activation errors  
- Duplicate tagging attempts  

These issues must be documented and corrected before kegs leave the brewery.

---

## 3. Optional (Recommended) Records

Although optional, these records strengthen compliance:

### 3.1 Cooler Separation Map
A diagram showing:
- NA keg storage locations  
- Mixed SKU zones  
- Tagging/activation areas  

Helps prevent errors and improves training.

### 3.2 Staff Assignment Log
Tracks:
- Which employees handle tagging  
- Who is trained/certified  
- Who performed each activation event  

### 3.3 Daily NA Keg Check
Checklist includes:
- Tag presence  
- Tag tightness (zip-tie not cut/loose)  
- Collar visibility  
- Activation scanning test  

---

## 4. DraftVerify Registry Record Types

### 4.1 Activation Record
Created when the tag is activated at the brewery.

Includes:
- DTI  
- Brewery  
- Product  
- Batch  

### 4.2 Verification Events
Created when distributors or venues scan the Coupler Tag.

Records:
- DTI  
- Timestamp  
- High-level location reference (venue or distributor, where enabled)  

### 4.3 Tag Retirement Records
Created when:
- Tag is damaged  
- Tag mis-assigned  
- Keg is reworked  
- Brewery reports a deactivation  

---

## 5. Documentation Retention Requirements

Breweries must retain DraftVerify documentation for:

**Minimum: 12 months**  
**Recommended: 24–36 months**

Documents must be stored in:

- Digital storage  
- Cloud systems  
- Brewery recordkeeping software  
- Or printed/physical systems (acceptable, but digital preferred)

Retention helps with:

- Recall investigations  
- Mis-serve investigations  
- Insurance claims  
- Audit verification  

---

## 6. Audit Readiness

Breweries must be able to produce:

- Activation logs  
- Batch/lot data  
- Tag inventory logs  
- Non-conformance reports  

Audit windows:

- **Scheduled** (with notice)  
- **Random** (spot checks)  
- **Triggered** (due to an incident)

DraftVerify may request screenshots, exports, or activation confirmations.

No proprietary brewing information is ever required.

---

## 7. Data Privacy & Security

DraftVerify will never request:

- Full recipes  
- Lab reports  
- Internal QA processes  
- Sensitive trade secrets

Only identity-relevant data is required.

Brewery data is:

- Encrypted  
- Access-controlled  
- Used solely for verification and safety purposes  

---

## 8. Summary

F-14 ensures breweries maintain accurate, traceable, and audit-ready records that support the DraftVerify identity system.  
These documents form the backbone of:

- traceability  
- safety  
- accountability  
- regulatory alignment  
- mis-serve prevention  

The stronger the documentation, the stronger the NA draft ecosystem.
