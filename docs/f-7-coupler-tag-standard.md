This document defines the **physical and digital requirements** for identifying non-alcoholic couplers in DraftVerify-compliant systems.  
The coupler is the **highest-risk identification point** in the NA draft pathway because it is the moment where an operator connects the system to a keg.

The Coupler Tag Standard ensures every NA coupler is unmistakable, traceable, and digitally validated.

## 1.0 Purpose

The Coupler Tag serves three primary functions:

1. **Prevent Mis-Serve**  
   The tag must make it visually and physically obvious that the coupler is assigned to a non-alcoholic keg.

2. **Maintain Draft Path Integrity**  
   Staff must be able to follow the NA identity chain from:
   **coupler → line → faucet** without ambiguity.

3. **Enable Digital Traceability**  
   When NFC is used, the coupler becomes a traceable control point linked to the DraftVerify Registry.

The coupler tag is the last checkpoint before beer enters the system.  
It must be impossible to ignore or misinterpret.

## 2.0 Required Identification Components

Every NA coupler must include one of the two approved identification systems:

### 2.1 Physical Coupler Marker (Mandatory if no NFC)
A physical NA marker must be applied directly to the coupler head.

Approved forms:
- NA Gold band (DraftVerify color #c7aa4a)
- clamp-on NA ring
- molded plastic NA identifier
- tamper-resistant clip

Requirements:
- visible during approach  
- visible in low-light cooler environments  
- cannot be mistaken for alcoholic equipment  
- cannot be removed accidentally during use  
- must withstand moisture and abrasion

### 2.2 NFC Coupler Tag (Optional but Recommended)
If NFC is used, the coupler must include:

- a **cryptographically-unique identifier**  
- a **tamper-resistant adhesive or mechanical mount**  
- direct linking to a DraftVerify Registry URL  
- scannability from a smartphone within 1–2 cm  

The NFC tag provides:
- verification events  
- chain-of-custody  
- inspection logs  
- installation timestamps  

The physical marker remains **mandatory** even if NFC is present.

## 3.0 Placement Requirements

Correct placement is essential to prevent misconnection.

### 3.1 Placement Zone
The coupler tag must be located:
- within **3 cm** of the spear/valve connection point  
- facing upward or outward  
- visible **before** engagement  

It must be seen:
- when picking up the coupler  
- when positioning it over the keg  
- during training  
- during audits  

### 3.2 Orientation
The identifier must:
- not rotate independently  
- not be obstructed by gas fittings  
- remain visible from the operator’s perspective  

### 3.3 NFC Placement
For NFC versions:
- tag must be placed on the coupler body, not the handle  
- must not interfere with mechanical operation  
- must not be placed on moving parts  
- must be waterproof (IP67 or better)

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Durability Requirements

Coupler identification must withstand:

- repeated keg changes  
- condensation  
- cleaning chemical exposure  
- abrasion from storage  
- high and low temperature cycles  
- physical impacts  

Labels or NFC housings must resist:
- peeling  
- fading  
- corrosion  
- ink transfer  
- cracking  

DraftVerify may approve specific materials for certified partners.

## 5.0 Brewery Responsibilities

Breweries supplying NA draft must:

- attach physical or NFC coupler markers before release  
- ensure marker matches the keg’s identity designation  
- ensure NFC tags are properly encoded  
- verify readability of the NFC UID  
- document coupler assignments in brewery logs  

Breweries **may not** ship NA kegs without compliant coupler identification.

<!-- SECTION 6 -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6.0 Venue Responsibilities

Venues must:

- use only NA-designated couplers for NA lines  
- inspect coupler tags at each keg change  
- reject kegs with missing, damaged, or mismatched markers  
- never interchange alcoholic couplers with NA couplers  
- maintain a coupler-to-line mapping log  

Venues must report exceptions and replace damaged tags immediately.

<!-- SECTION 7 -->

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7.0 Prohibited Practices

The following practices violate the DraftVerify Standard:

- using tape or handwritten identifiers  
- removing or relocating tags  
- using NA couplers on alcoholic kegs  
- applying markers post-connection  
- using NFC tags without activation  
- covering NA markers with wrap or foam  

Any violation must be logged as an **exception** in the DraftVerify Registry.
