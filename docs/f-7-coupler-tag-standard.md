# Coupler Tag Standard

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version: 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active  
<br>© 2025 DraftVerify™ Standards Initiative. All rights reserved.
</p>

The coupler is the **single most important interaction point** in the entire draft workflow.  
The **Coupler Tag** provides a permanent, verifiable, cryptographically-unique identity at the exact moment a keg is connected — ensuring that what is being tapped is truly what it claims to be.

This matters most for **non-alcoholic (NA)** draft, where mis-taps pose safety, regulatory, and reputational risks.

<!-- SECTION 1 — PURPOSE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 1. Purpose

The Coupler Tag Standard establishes:

- a **tamper-resistant digital identity point**  
- a way to confirm product identity *before* tapping  
- a consistent tagging method across breweries, distributors, and venues  
- a verification process that takes **under 2 seconds**  
- an audit trail proving correct tapping procedures  

The goal is **certainty at the point of connection**.

<!-- SECTION 2 — SCOPE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:

- breweries producing NA draft  
- distributors transporting NA kegs  
- venues serving NA products  
- any DraftVerify-certified operator  

Optional (recommended):

- alcoholic products requiring brand protection or identity tracking

This standard defines:

- tag hardware  
- NFC programming  
- URL structure  
- registry mapping  
- physical placement  
- verification workflow  
- minimum compliance requirements

<!-- SECTION 6 — PROGRAMMING & ASSIGNMENT -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 6. Programming & Assignment

### 6.1 Centralized Programming (Version 1.0)

For Version 1.0 of the DraftVerify Standard:

- All coupler tags are pre-programmed by DraftVerify before shipment.  
- Tags arrive sorted into product-specific bags.  
- Breweries simply apply the correct tags to the correct NA kegs.

This ensures accuracy and eliminates technical barriers.

### 6.2 Product Lock-In

Once a coupler tag is assigned:

- it may **not** be reassigned  
- it may **not** be reused  
- damaged tags must be retired and replaced  

### 6.3 Future Brewery-Side Programming (Optional)

Future versions may include:

- a DraftVerify programming app  
- on-site encoding tools  
- bulk programming workflows  

These are outside the scope of Version 1.0.

<!-- SECTION 7 — VERIFICATION WORKFLOW -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 7. Verification Workflow

### Step 1 — Visual Check
Staff visually confirm that a DraftVerify coupler tag is attached.

### Step 2 — NFC Scan
Before attaching the coupler:

- staff tap the tag with any NFC-capable phone  
- the encoded URL opens a real-time verification page  

### Step 3 — Confirmation
The verification page displays:

- brewery  
- product identity  
- NA category  
- style  
- tag status (must be active)  

### Step 4 — Connection
Once verified, staff attach the coupler and begin service prep.

### Step 5 — Logging
The scan is logged automatically in the DraftVerify Registry:

- tag ID  
- timestamp  
- venue reference (where enabled)  

These logs support audits, investigations, and responsible handling.

<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

### 8.1 Breweries
- apply coupler tags to all NA kegs  
- ensure tags match correct products  
- report damaged/missing tags  

### 8.2 Distributors
- protect tags during transport  
- avoid covering or damaging tags  
- report mismatches to breweries or DraftVerify  

### 8.3 Venues
- scan before tapping  
- do not cover or remove tags  
- maintain visibility at coupler area  
- report incorrect scan results

<!-- SECTION 9 — COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 9. Compliance Requirements

A venue is compliant with F-7 when:

- all NA kegs have a DraftVerify coupler tag  
- tags are scannable at the moment of connection  
- staff verify identity before tapping  
- tags remain intact and visible  
- damaged/missing tags are replaced promptly  

Alcoholic products may optionally use coupler tags for brand protection.  
For NA products, coupler tags are **mandatory**.

<!-- SECTION 10 — SUMMARY -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 10. Summary

The coupler tag is the **primary digital identity point** in the DraftVerify system.  
By standardizing placement, programming, and verification, DraftVerify creates:

- clearer workflows  
- safer service  
- fewer errors  
- stronger brand protection  
- documented accountability across the draft lifecycle  

This ensures correct identity **at the exact moment it matters most**.
