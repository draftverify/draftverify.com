This document provides the **authoritative glossary** for the DraftVerify Standards Library.  
All terms used across F-1 through F-40 derive their meaning from this document.  
If conflicts occur, **F-2 controls**.

---

## 1. Scope

This document defines:

- standardized vocabulary  
- identity architecture and object names  
- digital registry terminology  
- verification workflow language  
- labeling and NFC-specific terms  
- naming conventions for hardware, software, and physical tags  

---

## 2. Key Terminology

### **Non-Alcoholic Draft (NA Draft)**  
Any beverage served on draft containing **0.5% ABV or less**, as defined by regulatory bodies.

### **Identity Object**  
A uniquely identifiable physical or digital asset within the DraftVerify system.

Examples:  
- keg  
- coupler  
- draft line  
- faucet  
- NFC tag  
- digital registry entry  

### **Verification**  
The process of confirming the identity of a draft source using physical and digital signals.

### **NFC Identity Tag**  
A tamper-resistant tag containing a **cryptographically unique ID**, linked to a record in the DraftVerify Registry.

### **Registry Entry**  
A cloud-stored object that links:
- brewery  
- product  
- keg type  
- date data  
- verification status  
- tag history  

### **Coupler Tag**  
An NFC tag applied near the keg coupling point, enabling staff to verify identity at the moment of connection.

### **Line Tag**  
A physical or NFC tag applied to the draft line near the faucet, providing point-of-pour identity.

### **Verification Signal**  
Any data source confirming identity:  
- NFC scan  
- color-coded hardware  
- labeling  
- registry match  
- operator confirmation  

---

## 3. Naming Conventions

### Product Names  
Always presented as:

**Brewery · Product Name · Style · NA**

### Keg Identification  
Each keg identity includes:

- Brewery ID  
- Product ID  
- Batch or packaging identifier  
- NFC UID  

### Document References  
Documents are cited as:

> **F-X — Title**

## 4. Terminology Control

If a term appears in:

- packaging  
- registry fields  
- NFC apps  
- brewery documentation  
- training modules  
- operator guides  

…it must match **exactly** the definition in F-2.

No synonyms may be used in other documents unless listed as approved alternates.

---

## 5. Revision Control

Terminology changes appear only in:

**F-2 — Definitions, Scope & Terminology**

All other documents defer to this one.
