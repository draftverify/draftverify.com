## 1.0 Scope of This Document

This document establishes:

- the **formal terminology** used in all DraftVerify standards  
- the boundaries of what counts as “non-alcoholic draft”  
- classification rules for beverages, hardware, tags, and digital records  
- required interpretation rules that apply across all documents  

This document **must be read before any other DraftVerify standard**.

## 2.0 Foundational Definitions

### 2.1 Non-Alcoholic Beverage (NA Beverage)
A beverage that meets the **legal definition of non-alcoholic** in the jurisdiction where it is served.  
Common thresholds include:

- **≤ 0.5% ABV** (North America & EU)  
- **≤ 0.05% ABV** (strict jurisdictions)  

### 2.2 NA Draft
Any NA beverage dispensed through a pressurized draft system.

### 2.3 NA Draft Pathway
The continuous physical chain from:

**keg → coupler → line → chiller → tower → faucet**

A pathway is either **NA** or **Alcoholic** — never both.

### 2.4 Cross-Contact
Any event where an NA pathway becomes exposed to alcoholic product, including:

- incorrect hookups  
- shared lines  
- contaminated couplers or faucets  

### 2.5 Mixed Draft System
A system where NA and alcoholic products coexist in shared infrastructure.

### 2.6 NA Identity Architecture (NIA)
The structured visual + digital identity system defined in:

**ID-1 through ID-5 (Identity Architecture Series).**

Includes:

- keg markers  
- coupler tags  
- line ID tags  
- faucet markers  
- serialized encoding  
- symbol/color system

## 3.0 DraftVerify Tag System (Core Terminology)

### 3.1 DraftVerify Tag
A serialized identifier assigned to NA hardware.

### 3.2 Serialized Tag Number (STN)
Format:

**DV-SITE-YEAR-#####**

Example:  
**DV-CA027-2025-00432**

### 3.3 Digital Activation
A physical tag becomes valid only when activated in the **DraftVerify Registry**.

### 3.4 Identity Lockout
A forced stop state triggered by:

- cross-contact  
- missing tags  
- incomplete registry data  
- failed verification

  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px" markdown="1">

## 4.0 Operational Definitions

### 4.1 Verification Event
A documented check verifying:

- tag placement  
- activation status  
- cleaning schedule  
- identity continuity  

### 4.2 Cleaning Cycle
Any cleaning of draft hardware (line, coupler, faucet, tower).

### 4.3 System Modification Event
Any change requiring registry updates, including:

- relocating kegs  
- adding a line  
- hardware replacements  
- tower service  
- glycol work
