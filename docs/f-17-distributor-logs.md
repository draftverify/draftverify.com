<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active

The F-17 Standard defines the required **recordkeeping, reconciliation workflows, discrepancy protocols, and verification event logging** that distributors must maintain to protect the DraftVerify identity chain.

These logs provide:

- Traceability  
- Chain-of-custody integrity  
- Verification evidence  
- Discrepancy correction paths  
- Audit readiness  

F-17 ensures the accuracy and accountability of all distributor interactions with non-alcoholic (NA) draft kegs.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of F-17 is to:

- Ensure every NA keg received, stored, transported, and delivered is properly logged  
- Provide a clear reconciliation path for verifying inventory accuracy  
- Enable rapid investigation of delivery or identity mismatches  
- Maintain digitally accessible records for audits  
- Preserve the brewery-created DraftVerify identity  

These logs form the backbone of distributor compliance.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to:

- Distribution warehouses  
- Delivery drivers  
- Dispatch coordinators  
- Inventory managers  
- 3PL partners  
- Cross-dock operations  

Covers the logging and reconciliation of:

- Receiving events  
- Storage movements  
- Transport events  
- Verification scans  
- Delivery handoffs  
- Discrepancies and incident reports  

---

## 3. Required Log Types

Distributors must maintain four core logs:

1. **Receiving Log**  
2. **Storage Log**  
3. **Transport Log**  
4. **Discrepancy & Incident Log**

Each log must be:

- Accurate  
- Legible  
- Date/time-stamped  
- Tied to responsible personnel  
- Stored for a minimum of 18 months  

Digital, paper, or hybrid systems are permitted.

---

## 4. Receiving Log Requirements

The Receiving Log must capture:

- Date received  
- Supplier brewery  
- Product name  
- Batch or fill date (if provided)  
- DraftVerify Tag ID (DTI)  
- Verification scan result  
- Tag integrity notes (zip tie, rotation, tampering)  
- Initials of receiving staff  

### 4.1 Mandatory Verification Scan  
Every NA keg must be scanned upon arrival.

Scan must confirm:

- Correct brewery identity  
- Correct product identity  
- Active tag status  
- NA product clearly indicated  

### 4.2 Receiving Discrepancies  
If issues are found:

- Keg is quarantined  
- Brewery is notified  
- Discrepancy is logged in the Incident Log  

---

## 5. Storage Log Requirements

The Storage Log must document:

- NA zone location  
- Storage movements  
- Re-stacking events  
- Tag visibility issues  
- Temperature excursions (if monitored)  
- Staff initials  

### 5.1 NA Separation Confirmation  
Log must include confirmation that NA products remain:

- Segregated from alcoholic products  
- Properly labeled  
- Free of mixed palletization  

### 5.2 Storage Discrepancies  
Examples include:

- Damaged tags  
- Missing collars  
- Kegs left in incorrect zones  

These must be logged and corrected immediately.

---

## 6. Transport Log Requirements

Transport Logs must record:

- Vehicle ID or route number  
- Driver identity  
- Date and time of departure  
- Destination venue  
- List of keg identities (with DTIs)  
- Pre-transport verification scan results  
- Load integrity checks (stacking, stability, tag visibility)  

### 6.1 Mandatory Pre-Transport Scan  
Each NA keg must be scanned before loading.

Scan must confirm:

- Active tag  
- Correct product  
- No mismatch  
- Tag not tampered with  

### 6.2 Load Placement Documentation  
Distributors must document:

- NA/alcoholic separation  
- Use of physical barriers (if mixed vehicle loads)  
- Securing methods (straps, bars, shrink-wrap)  

---

## 7. Delivery Reconciliation Log

At each venue, distributors must complete a Delivery Reconciliation Log including:

- Venue name  
- Date/time  
- Driver signature  
- Venue staff signature  
- DTI of each keg delivered  
- Verification scan results at venue  
- Confirmed match to purchase order  

### 7.1 Required Joint Verification  
Driver and venue staff must scan each keg **together**.

### 7.2 Delivery Discrepancies  
Examples:

- Wrong product  
- Incorrect count  
- Inactive or mismatched DTI  
- Tag damage discovered at delivery  

Must be logged and escalated immediately.

---

## 8. Discrepancy & Incident Log Requirements

The Incident Log is used for any deviation from DraftVerify standards.

Record:

- Date/time  
- Personnel involved  
- Description of issue  
- Affected keg DTI  
- Photos (recommended)  
- Immediate corrective action  
- Final resolution  

### 8.1 Examples of Incidents  
- Tag torn off  
- Zip tie cut or loose  
- Tag rotated  
- Wrong product delivered  
- NA/alcoholic segregation failure  
- Keg dropped or rolled  
- Temperature excursion  

### 8.2 Escalation Path  
Incidents must be escalated to:

1. Distributor supervisor  
2. Brewery partner  
3. DraftVerify (if required)  

---

## 9. Monthly Reconciliation Requirements

Distributors must perform a monthly reconciliation that compares:

- Received kegs  
- Stored inventory  
- Outbound kegs  
- Delivered kegs  
- Discrepancies and resolutions  

### 9.1 Variance Investigation  
Any mismatch must be:

- Investigated  
- Documented  
- Resolved  
- Reported to brewery  

### 9.2 Digital Submission (Recommended)  
A monthly summary may be submitted to DraftVerify for audit support.

---

## 10. Audit Readiness

- Complete  
- Accessible  
- Stored securely  
- Available for random audits  

DraftVerify may request:

- Copies of logs  
- Monthly summaries  
- Incident reports  
- Verification scan exports  

Failure to provide records may result in compliance review.

---

## 11. Compliance Requirements

A distributor is **F-17 compliant** when:

- All logs are maintained accurately  
- Verification scans are completed at required steps  
- Discrepancies are documented and resolved  
- Reconciliations are complete  
- Staff follow logging procedures  

Non-compliance may lead to:

- Required corrective action  
- Suspension of verified distributor status  
- Exclusion from DraftVerify NA programs  

---

## 12. Summary

F-17 defines the logging and reconciliation backbone that protects the DraftVerify identity chain.  
Distributors play a central role in maintaining:

- Accurate traceability  
- Verification integrity  
- Resolution of discrepancies  
- Accountability at every touchpoint  

These logs ensure safe, consistent, and trustworthy NA draft delivery across the entire system.
