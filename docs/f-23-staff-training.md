---

## 3. Core Training Topics

Employees must demonstrate understanding of the following topics.

---

## 3.1 Understanding NA Draft & Why It Matters

Non-alcoholic draft carries unique risks because:

- Consumers expect **0.0% alcohol** or ≤0.5%  
- Mis-serving alcoholic beer can cause legal and health issues  
- NA customers include minors, designated drivers, pregnant individuals, and medically restricted guests  

Staff must understand:

- NA draft is NOT the same as alcoholic draft  
- Verification prevents dangerous and costly mistakes  

---

## 3.2 DraftVerify Identity System Overview

Staff must be familiar with:

### **Keg Collar**
Displays product, color band, and NA markings.

### **Coupler Tag (NFC)**
Zip-tied tag used for digital verification.

### **Line Tag**
Identifies the beverage line in the cooler.

### **Tower/Faucet ID**  
Optional, but useful for high-volume venues.

The identity chain must always match:

**Keg → Coupler Tag → Line Tag → Faucet**

---

## 4. Staff Responsibilities

### 4.1 Before Tapping a Keg
Staff must:

1. Locate the correct Line Tag  
2. Verify the Coupler Tag using NFC  
3. Confirm the product matches the venue’s menu  
4. Inspect zip tie for tampering  
5. Connect only after verification  

### 4.2 During Service
Staff must:

- Monitor that taps remain labeled correctly  
- Ensure no one alters line tags  
- Report any product taste anomalies  
- Avoid temporary product substitutions without manager approval  

### 4.3 After Service
Staff must:

- Disconnect kegs properly  
- Replace empty kegs only with verified ones  
- Log issues or anomalies  

---

## 5. Daily Verification Routine

Each shift must complete the following:

### 5.1 Opening Checks
- Ensure all NA faucets are labeled  
- Confirm NO alcoholic product is on NA lines  
- Perform NFC scan on any newly tapped keg  
- Record verification result (see F-19 checklist)

### 5.2 Mid-Shift Checks
- Confirm tap handles or labels have not been moved  
- Monitor kegroom organization  
- Report any suspicious issues  

### 5.3 Closing Checks
- Confirm tap assignments remain correct  
- Note which kegs are nearing depletion  
- Log any required service or cleaning needs  

---

## 6. How to Perform a Proper NFC Verification

### Step 1 — Unlock phone (no app needed)  
Android: Tap with screen on  
iPhone: Tap the top of the phone to the tag

### Step 2 — Wait for auto-open  
A secure DraftVerify page will open.

### Step 3 — Confirm the following appear:
- Brewery name  
- Product identity  
- Style  
- Category (**Non-Alcoholic**)  
- Tag status (**Active**)  

### Step 4 — Compare identity  
Ensure the product displayed matches:

- Menu item  
- Line tag  
- Order request  

### Step 5 — Only then connect the keg  
If anything does not match → **STOP** and escalate.

## 7. Mis-Serve Prevention Rules

A mis-serve is **ANY** instance where alcoholic beer is served when NA was requested.  
Staff must follow:

### 7.1 Zero-Assumption Policy  
Never assume a keg is correct just because:

- It looks familiar  
- A co-worker tapped it  
- The handle “should” match  

### 7.2 Mandatory Verification  
If it wasn’t scanned this shift, it must be verified.

### 7.3 No Cross-Use of Lines  
NA lines must remain NA-only.

### 7.4 Immediate Escalation  
If in doubt → do not pour → call manager.

---

## 8. Escalation Protocol (When Something Looks Wrong)

### Staff must notify a manager immediately if:
- NFC scan is incorrect  
- Tag appears tampered  
- The keg tastes wrong  
- The line map doesn’t match what’s connected  
- A tag is missing  

### Manager must:
- Stop service from the affected faucet  
- Follow F-22 Incident Response Procedure  
- Document the issue  

---

## 9. Training Assessment

Each staff member must pass:

### 9.1 Written Assessment (or digital)
Covers:

- Identity components  
- Verification steps  
- Mis-serve prevention  
- Escalation steps  

### 9.2 Practical Assessment
Employee must:

- Correctly identify line tags

### 9.3 Certification  
Upon completion, staff are marked as **DraftVerify-Trained**.

Re-certification required **annually** or after any major system update.

---

## 10. Documentation Requirements

All venues must maintain:

- Staff training logs

Documents must be available during DraftVerify audits.
