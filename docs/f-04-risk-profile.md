# NA Draft Risk Profile & Rationale

This document explains the **unique risks associated with non-alcoholic (NA) draft beverages**, and provides the formal rationale for the DraftVerify Standard.  
Unlike alcoholic draft, NA draft introduces **distinct safety, legal, operational, and reputational risks** that the industry has never formally addressed—until now.

The DraftVerify Standard exists to mitigate these risks through **physical identification**, **digital verification**, **line separation**, and **operational discipline**.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Risk Profile

### 1.1 Why This Document Exists  
NA draft has grown rapidly, but draft systems were historically designed only for alcoholic beer.  
This mismatch creates vulnerabilities that can:

- endanger consumers  
- violate alcohol-service laws  
- harm brewery brands  
- expose venues to liability  
- erode trust in NA draft as a category  

DraftVerify provides a framework to eliminate these vulnerabilities.

### 1.2 How This Document Is Used  
This risk profile forms the foundation for:

- **F-3** Identity Architecture  
- **F-5** Legal Basis  
- **F-6 to F-10** Physical Identification Standards  
- **F-18 to F-23** Venue Procedures  
- **F-28 to F-32** Digital and Compliance Standards  

---

## 2. Safety & Public Health Risks

### 2.1 Mis-Serve to Minors or Abstainers  
A mis-serve of alcoholic beer **in place of an NA product** can harm:

- minors  
- designated drivers  
- pregnant individuals  
- individuals in recovery  
- people avoiding alcohol for religious, cultural, or medical reasons  

Consequences include:

- alcohol exposure  
- legal penalties  
- reputational damage  
- consumer distrust  

NA drinkers expect a **zero-risk** experience.

### 2.2 Physiological Adverse Reactions  
Even small exposures to alcohol can trigger:

- medication interactions  
- allergic responses  
- health complications  

### 2.3 Cross-Contact During Cleaning or Switching  
If NA lines and alcoholic lines are not clearly identified:

- alcohol residues may remain in the line  
- operators may connect the wrong keg  
- product switching may introduce contamination  

Line separation is therefore mandatory.

---

## 3. Legal & Regulatory Risks

### 3.1 Legal Responsibility in Alcohol Service  
A venue serving alcoholic beer when the consumer believes it is NA may violate:

- alcohol licensing laws  
- age-restriction statutes  
- consumer protection laws  
- truth-in-service regulations  

### 3.2 Misrepresentation of Alcohol Content  
Serving alcoholic beer as NA is considered **misrepresentation** under most jurisdictions.

Penalties may include:

- license suspension  
- fines  
- investigations  
- civil liability  

### 3.3 Absence of Global Standards  
Alcoholic draft has long-standing norms.  
NA draft does not.

This creates:

- inconsistent labeling  
- non-uniform procedures  
- ambiguous line usage  
- varied interpretations of “non-alcoholic”  

DraftVerify resolves this ambiguity.

---

## 4. Operational Risks

### 4.1 Staff Confusion  
Operators face:

- similar branding  
- rotating taps  
- high turnover  
- multiple keg types  
- mixed NA/alcoholic towers  

Without clear identification, errors are inevitable.

### 4.2 Product Switching Errors  
Kegs are frequently switched in high-volume venues.  
Without NA-specific identifiers:

- alcoholic kegs may be connected to NA lines  
- NA kegs may be placed on alcoholic pathways  
- operators may assume a line is “already NA” when it is not  

### 4.3 Cleaning & Maintenance Failures  
If NA lines are not clearly tagged:

- lines may be flushed improperly  
- cleaning crews may reconnect the wrong product  
- maintenance teams may misconfigure lines  

These failures compromise NA integrity.

---

## 5. Brand, Trust & Social Risk

### 5.1 NA Consumers Expect Zero Ambiguity  
NA drinkers are willing to trust a venue—but only once.  
A single mistake can:

- damage trust  
- harm local brand reputation  
- impair brewery relationships  

### 5.2 Brewery Reputation at Stake  
If a mis-serve occurs:

- consumers blame the **brewery**, not the venue  
- social media amplifies incidents instantly  
- NA product credibility erodes industry-wide  

### 5.3 Social Media Amplification  
Mis-serve incidents spread quickly:

- videos  
- influencer posts  
- local news  
- national publications  

DraftVerify prevents these catastrophic failures.

## 6. Economic Risks

### 6.1 Direct Financial Loss  
Mis-taps, contaminated lines, and incorrect keg connections lead to:

- wasted product  
- returned kegs  
- service interruptions  

### 6.2 Lost Brand Equity  
Brewery NA divisions are highly image-sensitive.  
A mis-serve undercuts:

- national partnerships  
- retail distribution  
- regional sales expansion  

### 6.3 Liability Exposure  
Venues may face:

- increased insurance premiums  
- civil actions  
- loss of license  
- loss of brewery partnerships  

---

## 7. Rationale for the DraftVerify Standard

DraftVerify mitigates NA draft risks by enforcing:

### 7.1 Physical Identity  
- keg collars  
- coupler tags  
- line tags  
- faucet identifiers  
- color-coded pathways  

### 7.2 Digital Verification  
- NFC scanning  
- cryptographic identity  
- activation logic  
- verification event logging  

### 7.3 Operational Separation  
- dedicated NA pathways  
- switching protocols  
- audit and compliance structures  

### 7.4 Accountability  
- staff verification  
- registry event trails  
- distributor check points  

DraftVerify replaces **assumptions** with **intelligent verification**.

## 8. Relationship to Other Standards

F-4 provides direct justification for:

- **F-5** Legal Basis  
- **F-6** Keg Identification  
- **F-7** Coupler Tags  
- **F-8** Line Identification  
- **F-9** Faucet Identification  
- **F-18** Venue Verification Protocol  
- **F-22** Incident Response  
- **F-31** Audit & Traceability  
- **F-32** Certification & Use of Mark Policy  

Where regulatory requirements differ, **legal obligations override DraftVerify**.

---

## 9. Governance & Revision

Updates to F-4 occur when:

- new risks are discovered  
- NA draft service evolves  
- incident reports require changes  
- new technologies are introduced
