# Beer Line Identification Standard

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:#6b7280;">
Version: 1.0 · Publication Date: 2025-01-01 · Status: Active  
<br>© 2025 DraftVerify™ Standards Initiative. All rights reserved.
</p>

The Line Identification Standard defines how beverage lines must be labeled, verified, and mapped from the keg in the cooler to the faucet on the tower.  
This system eliminates mis-taps, prevents NA cross-contamination, and supports DraftVerify’s digital verification layer.

Line identification protects:

- Product accuracy  
- Consumer safety  
- Brand integrity  
- Operational consistency  
- Distributor accountability  

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard establishes a universal method for identifying beverage lines using:

- Physical line tags  
- Optional tower markers  
- Coupler-side NFC verification  
- A unified map linking keg → coupler → line → faucet  

This ensures that the correct product always flows through the correct line.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to:

- Bars  
- Restaurants  
- Breweries  
- Stadiums and arenas  
- Distributors  
- Multi-venue operations using NA or alcoholic draft  

It defines:

- Line tag specifications  
- Placement rules  
- Optional tower marker usage  
- Category color coding  
- Verification workflows  
- Compliance requirements  

---

## 3. Components of the Identification System

### 3.1 Line Tag (Primary Identifier)

A durable physical tag attached near the coupler.  
It displays:

- Product name  
- Category color  
- Optional style text  
- Short alphanumeric identity code (not a URL)  

This is the **primary visual identifier**.

### 3.2 Coupler Tag (Digital Verification Point)

An NFC-enabled tag on the coupler.  
Used to:

- Confirm product identity  
- Validate NA vs alcoholic  
- Link keg → line in the registry  
- Support verification logs  

This is the **digital identity point**.

### 3.3 Tower Marker (Optional)

A faucet-side identifier used for:

- High-volume venues  
- Stadium environments  
- Rotational, seasonal, or large tap banks  

Tower markers are recommended but not required.

---

## 4. Placement Requirements

### 4.1 Line Tag Placement

Line tags must be:

- attached within 30–45 cm (12–18 in.) of the coupler  
- facing outward  
- placed on the product line, not adjacent lines  
- secure yet removable for maintenance  
- clear of sharp bends, moisture traps, or heat sources  

### 4.2 Coupler Tag Placement

The Coupler Tag (F-7 Standard) must be:

- on or immediately beside the coupler body  
- visible before attachment  
- scannable without obstruction  

### 4.3 Tower Marker Placement (Optional)

May be placed on:

- faucet collars  
- tower faceplates  
- adjacent tap rail  

Not required for compliance.

---

## 5. Identification Hierarchy

To ensure clarity, DraftVerify uses the following hierarchy:

1. **Primary Identifier:** Line Tag  
2. **Digital Verification:** Coupler NFC Tag  
3. **Service-Side Indicator (Optional):** Tower Marker  

This ensures consistent identity from end to end.

---

## 6. Category Color Coding

| Category | Color | Requirement |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Non-Alcoholic (NA) | Gold | **Mandatory** |
| Alcoholic | Blue | Recommended |
| Seasonal / Rotational | Teal | Optional |
| House / Staff | Grey | Optional |

Gold must always represent NA draft lines.

---

## 7. Verification Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify  
Operator reads the **Line Tag**.

### Step 2 — Verify  
Operator scans the **Coupler Tag** using an NFC-enabled smartphone.

The page displays:

- brewery  
- product  
- classification (NA highlighted)  

### Step 3 — Connect  
Operator connects the coupler only after verification.

### Step 4 — Audit (Automatic)  
If enabled, the scan is stored in the DraftVerify Registry.

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

### Breweries  
- Provide accurate product naming  
- Supply correct category colors  
- Ensure consistency across all materials  

### Distributors  
- Ensure correct line tags accompany deliveries  
- Maintain tag visibility during transport  
- Report mismatches  

### Venues  
- Apply line tags correctly  
- Verify identity before tapping  
- Maintain cleanliness and visibility  
- Replace worn or damaged tags  

---

## 9. Compliance Requirements

A venue is **F-8 compliant** when:

- each draft line has a Line Tag  
- all NA lines use the gold category color  
- all NA kegs have Coupler Tags  
- verification occurs before connecting new kegs  
- optional markers (if used) are placed correctly  

---

## 10. Rationale

Line misidentification causes:

- wrong product on tap  
- NA contamination  
- brand misrepresentation  
- inconsistent service during staff turnover  
- distributor blame disputes  

DraftVerify eliminates these issues by standardizing line identity.

---

## 11. Summary

The Line Identification Standard ensures each draft product is clearly and consistently identified from keg to faucet.  
Physical identifiers provide clarity.  
Digital verification provides certainty.  
Together, they form a safe, accountable, modern draft system.
