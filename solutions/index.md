# Solutions
DraftVerify is built for every operator who needs certainty around a non-alcoholic tap. Different roles experience different risks — and DraftVerify addresses all of them with one standard.

---

## For Venues (Bars, Restaurants, Taprooms)
**Problem:** NA taps are visually identical to alcoholic taps. Staff turnover and busy service create real risk of accidental mis-pours.

**What DraftVerify Provides:**

- Clear identification from keg → faucet  
- A fast verification check for new staff  
- A digital record showing the tap is configured correctly  
- Confidence that NA guests are served accurately  

**Outcome:** Reduced liability and a safer guest experience.

---

## For Breweries
**Problem:** Breweries are increasingly asked for NA draft, yet cross-connection, contamination, and mis-representation risks make it difficult to support confidently.

**What DraftVerify Provides:**

- A uniform tagging system for all partner venues  
- A traceable registry of NA taps serving your product  
- Monthly verification logs  
- A standardized program your sales team can rely on  

**Outcome:** You can offer NA draft safely and consistently across your network.

## For Chains & Groups
**Problem:** Multi-location operations require consistent safety practices, consistent labeling, and documented verification across dozens or hundreds of taps.

**What DraftVerify Provides:**

- A standardized NA draft identification policy  
- Chain-wide rollout templates  
- Digital oversight via the Registry  
- Annual compliance summaries  

**Outcome:** Uniform execution and proof of compliance across every store.

---

## For Distributors & Field Reps
**Problem:** Reps service dozens of venues and need a simple way to ensure NA taps are correctly connected without spending extra time in the cooler.

**What DraftVerify Provides:**

- Faster service visits  
- Immediate visual identification  
- A consistent verification workflow  
- Historical verification records per venue  

**Outcome:** More accurate installs, fewer call-backs, and a traceable standard your team can follow.
