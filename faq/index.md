    <div class="faq-list" style="max-width:820px;margin:30px auto 0;">

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>What is DraftVerify?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          DraftVerify is the global identification and contamination-prevention standard for 
          non-alcoholic draft. It creates a consistent visual and digital system that links 
          <strong>keg → line → faucet</strong>, ensuring NA products are stored, connected, and 
          served correctly every time.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>Is DraftVerify only visual tags?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          No. DraftVerify includes a full <strong>software traceability layer</strong> that tracks 
          tag IDs, verification events, line changes, service checks, and training completion. 
          The physical tags are just the entry point into a much larger data system.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>Why do venues need DraftVerify?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          NA products are the only beverages that can be <strong>misidentified</strong> during 
          draft service. Busy shifts, shared towers, and equipment changes create real risks.  
          DraftVerify ensures clarity for staff and confidence for guests.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>Is DraftVerify required by law?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          No — it is an <strong>industry standard</strong>, not a regulation.  
          However, breweries and large groups are adopting it to protect their NA products 
          and to establish consistency across their locations.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>Can alcoholic lines use DraftVerify?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Breweries can adopt an alcoholic companion system, but DraftVerify remains 
          dedicated to the NA category to preserve clarity. An alcoholic version would use 
          different markings and would not dilute the NA standard.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Pricing depends on your venue count and tagging volume.  
          See the <a href="{{ '/pricing/' | relative_url }}">Pricing page</a>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>Can DraftVerify be adopted across multiple locations?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. The platform supports <strong>multi-venue dashboards</strong>, distributor views, 
          and enterprise onboarding — ideal for groups, chains, and breweries with taproom networks.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary><strong>Is training included?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. The DraftVerify Academy provides modules on line cleaning, keg handling, 
          cross-contamination prevention, verification workflows, and compliance tracking.
        </p>
