    <h2 class="h2">Training That Sticks — Without the Red Tape</h2>
    <p style="max-width:860px">
      The DraftVerify Training Series was created to raise awareness and set clear expectations for how
      non-alcoholic draft systems should be identified, cleaned, and maintained.  
      It’s not an audit or inspection — it’s a short, educational resource for bar teams, owners, and technicians who care about doing things right.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p style="max-width:860px">
      As non-alcoholic draft service grows, many venues are navigating new territory.  
      This training helps teams understand the basics: how to identify verified systems,
      how to avoid accidental mix-ups, and how to maintain confidence in every pour.
      Completion is voluntary and designed purely to support responsible service.

    <h2 class="h2">Three Core Modules</h2>
    <div class="grid cols-3" style="margin-top:22px">
      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Module 1 — Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          A simple overview of DraftVerify’s purpose and global role in protecting the integrity of
          non-alcoholic draft beverages.  
          It explains how the holographic sticker and line tags work together to create a consistent
          identification system recognized across venues.

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Module 2 — Understanding the Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Focused on staff awareness, this module covers the most common mix-ups and how to avoid them:
          cross-contact with alcoholic lines, cleaning lapses, and service confusion.  
          It emphasizes communication between shifts and simple checks that protect both the guest and the venue’s reputation.

      <div class="card reveal">
        <h3>Module 3 — Technical Awareness for Operators & Experts</h3>
        <p>
          For technicians, owners, and distributors — this module outlines practical best practices for setup,
          coupler labeling, gas isolation, and record-keeping.  
          It’s meant to align everyone on the same language and expectations, not to replace any local codes
          or manufacturer standards.

    <h2 class="h2">Interactive Quiz & Recognition</h2>
    <p style="max-width:860px">
      Each participant can complete a short interactive quiz at the end of training to reinforce their learning.
      A passing score unlocks a <strong>Digital Certificate of Completion</strong> — a recognition of awareness,
      not a legal or technical qualification.  
      Certificates can be downloaded or linked to a venue’s DraftVerify record to show commitment to best practices.
