# DraftVerify Glossary  
### The Official Terminology for Non-Alcoholic Draft Systems

This glossary defines the core terms used in the **DraftVerify Standard v1.0** and across the non-alcoholic draft ecosystem.  
It exists to provide clear, consistent language for venues, breweries, distributors, installers, and training teams.

For full operational rules, see the

## A {#a}

### **Alcoholic Draft**  
Any beverage above the non-alcoholic threshold (>0.5% ABV) served through draft infrastructure.  
Alcoholic and NA draft systems must **never** share lines without re-verification.

### **Annual Renewal**  
The once-per-year re-verification required under the DraftVerify Standard to confirm that identification, handling, and separation controls remain in place.

---

## C {#c}

### **Change Log**  
A documented record of hardware, routing, or gas configuration changes. Required for system traceability under DraftVerify.

### **Cleaning Log**  
A record of cleaning frequency, chemicals, procedures, and responsible personnel.

### **Cold Chain**  
The refrigerated handling pathway from storage to pour. NA draft kegs should be kept at ≤ 4°C where feasible.

### **Cross-Contact**  
Unintentional introduction of alcoholic liquid or vapor into a non-alcoholic draft pathway.  
Caused by: shared lines, incorrect changeovers, backflow, or poor handling.

---

## D {#d}

### **Draft Line**  
The tubing that carries product from keg to faucet.  
Under DraftVerify, the NA draft line must be visibly identifiable from start to finish.

### **DraftVerify (DV)**  
The global identification and verification standard for non-alcoholic draft systems.

### **DraftVerify Certified**  
A designation for systems that meet the requirements of the DraftVerify Standard v1.0, verified by an authorized verifier.

---

## E {#e}

### **Events & Mobile Service**  
Temporary draft setups (jockey boxes, mobile bars, festivals). These must follow the same NA identification and separation standards as permanent installations.

---

## F {#f}

### **Field Testing**  
Optional contamination testing that may include ethanol screening, rinse-through sampling, or hygiene testing.

---

## G {#g}

### **Gas Supply**  
The CO₂, nitrogen, or blended gas system driving beverage flow.  
Must be installed to prevent migration/backflow into NA lines.

---

## I {#i}

### **Identification (DraftVerify Context)**  
The physical system of labeling NA kegs, lines, and faucets so staff can trace the correct path visually from keg → line → faucet.

### **Incident Response**  
The process of isolating and re-verifying a line after suspected contamination or mis-pour.

### **Initial Verification**  
The first full inspection that results in issuance of a serialized DraftVerify tag and registry entry.

---

## J {#j}

### **Jockey Box**  
A portable event draft system with lines running through ice or a cold plate.  
Must be dedicated or re-verified before NA use.

---

## K {#k}

### **Keg Tag**  
A physical identifier indicating that a keg is part of the NA draft system.  
One of the three key points in the DraftVerify visual path.

---

## L {#l}

### **Line Marker**  
A visible marker on the NA draft line linking the verified keg to the correct faucet.

---

## M {#m}

### **Major Non-Conformity (Major NC)**  
A serious issue that presents immediate risk of contamination, misidentification, or guest confusion.

### **Minor Non-Conformity (Minor NC)**  
A procedural or documentation issue that must be corrected but does not present immediate contamination risk.

---

## N {#n}

### **Non-Alcoholic (NA)**  
A beverage at or below 0.5% ABV, or the local legal threshold.

### **NA Draft System**  
A draft system dedicated to or configured for dispensing non-alcoholic beverages, requiring identification, separation, and verification.

---

## P {#p}

### **Post-Modification Review**  
Re-verification performed after any system change affecting NA integrity.

---

## R {#r}

### **Registry (DraftVerify Registry)**  
The secure database that stores tag IDs, verification dates, venue info, and traceability data.

---

## S {#s}

### **Separation**  
The physical and procedural measures preventing NA draft lines from sharing infrastructure with alcoholic lines.

### **Serialized Tag**  
A unique identifier such as **DV-SITE-YYYY-#####** used to track a verified NA draft connection point.

### **Shared Tower**  
A tower where NA and alcoholic faucets coexist, requiring strict identification to avoid cross-contact or mis-pours.

---

## T {#t}

### **Tag (DraftVerify Tag)**  
The serialized physical label applied at an NA connection point.

### **Tower Sticker**  
The visible marker at the faucet indicating that the tap dispenses a verified NA product.

---

## V {#v}

### **Verification**  
Assessment of NA draft system conformance to the DraftVerify Standard.  
Includes identification checks, documentation review, and optional field testing.

### **Verification Record**  
The documented result of a verification event, including date, venue, verifier, findings, and non-conformities.

### **Verifier**  
An individual or entity authorized to assess and certify a system under the DraftVerify Standard.

---

## W {#w}

### **Written Procedures**  
Documentation describing how a venue maintains NA identification, separation, cleaning, and incident response.
