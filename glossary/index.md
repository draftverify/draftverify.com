        <h3>What is DraftVerify?</h3>
        <p>
          DraftVerify is the combined <strong>physical identification system</strong> and 
          <strong>digital traceability platform</strong> for non-alcoholic draft. It defines how NA
          kegs, lines, and faucets are marked, separated from alcoholic products, and tracked over time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <h3>Why does non-alcoholic draft need its own standard?</h3>
        <p>
          In mixed systems, it is easy for NA lines to be misidentified, re-used for alcoholic products,
          or connected to the wrong faucet. The DraftVerify Standard creates one clear, repeatable way to
          prevent cross-contact and mis-pours so guests can trust that an NA tap is truly non-alcoholic.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <h3>Is DraftVerify hardware, software, or both?</h3>
        <p>
          Both. DraftVerify uses visible tags and markers on the hardware, and a digital registry behind
          them. A system is only considered <strong>DraftVerify compliant</strong> when the physical tags
          are in place <em>and</em> each tag is digitally activated and recorded in the DraftVerify Registry.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <h3>Do we need to replace our entire draft system?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The standard is designed to work with typical draft setups. Most venues apply DraftVerify by
          adding identification, confirming separation, and implementing simple verification and logging
          procedures on top of their existing equipment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <h3>Who can act as a verifier?</h3>
        <p>
          A verifier is a person or organization trained to assess a system against the DraftVerify Standard.
          This may be a brewery representative, a distributor, a draft technician, or a designated internal
          operator, depending on how a group chooses to implement the program.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <h3>What does it mean for a venue to be “DraftVerify Certified”?</h3>
        <p>
          Certification indicates that the venue’s non-alcoholic draft system meets the requirements of
          DraftVerify Standard v1.0, that serialized tags have been activated in the Registry, and that
          verification, cleaning, and change records are being maintained in good standing.

    <dl class="glossary-list" style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto">
      <dt><strong>Non-Alcoholic (NA)</strong></dt>

      <dt><strong>NA Draft System</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A draft system, or part of a system, dedicated to dispensing non-alcoholic beverages.
        Under the DraftVerify Standard, NA draft pathways must be clearly identified and separated
        from alcoholic lines.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Cross-Contact</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Unintentional introduction of alcoholic liquid or vapor into a non-alcoholic draft pathway,
        caused by shared lines, fittings, towers, gas supply, or incorrect procedures.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Draft Line</strong></dt>
      <dd>The tubing that carries product from the keg to the faucet.</dd>

      <dt><strong>DraftVerify Tag</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A serialized identifier applied at a non-alcoholic draft connection point (for example, a keg

      </dd>

      <dt><strong>DraftVerify Registry</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The secure digital system where serialized tags, verification events, changes, and related

      <dt><strong>Digital Activation</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The process of registering a physical DraftVerify tag in the Registry and linking it to a
        specific venue, system component, and date. A tag is only considered valid once it has been
        activated.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Verification</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The assessment of a non-alcoholic draft system against the DraftVerify Standard, including

      <dt><strong>Annual Renewal</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A scheduled re-verification to confirm that identification, separation, and recordkeeping

      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Separation</strong></dt>
      <dd>

        pathways, even when equipment such as towers or manifolds is shared.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Identification (DraftVerify Context)</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The visual language used to show which kegs, lines, and faucets are part of the NA draft path,
        typically via DraftVerify tags, line markers, and faucet marks.

        A serious issue that presents an active risk of cross-contact, misidentification, or guest
        confusion. Systems with Major NCs cannot be considered compliant until resolved.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Minor Non-Conformity (Minor NC)</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A documentation or labelling issue that does not present an immediate contamination risk but
        still requires correction within a defined time window.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>DraftVerify Certified</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Status granted to systems that meet the DraftVerify Standard, have active tags in the Registry,
        and maintain verification, cleaning, and change records in good standing.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Shared Tower</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A draught tower where NA and alcoholic faucets coexist. These setups require clear identification
